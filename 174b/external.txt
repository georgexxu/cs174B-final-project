DOC121 after being scared away from rock & rita 's , we ended up at this place , which was , if nothing else , quieter .  i 'll start by saying that the hostess and our server were both lovely and they 're really what earned the single star , because they were sweet , but the food was just horrible .  i ordered a simple grilled cheese sandwich . i asked the server if it was processed cheese , or `` real '' cheese in the sandwich and he had no idea what i was talking about . i tried to clarify by saying , `` is it like kraft single slices , or deli cheese ? '' he said it was `` good '' . this really should have been a sign and i could probably fault the waiter for this , since you should know what you 're serving , but he was so sweet , i could n't be mad !  my husband ordered a hot dog of sorts .  i asked if there was a way to substitute fries for a salad . there was not , but the server hooked me up and brought me a salad anyway ( no charge ) . i asked for sweet potato fries with the sandwich .  of course , my sandwich was made with plasticy , processed cheese , that was melted to the point of cheeze-wiz and was inedible . i took one bite of the sandwich and could n't do another . i got regular fries , instead of sweet potato ( did n't bother complaining , because i got the free salad , so whatever ... like i said , nice server ! ) my husband 's food was fine , although nothing special . they were good with the refills of our drinks .  anyway , as nice as the servers were , it was n't good . i would avoid eating here if i could .
DOC122 we got recommendations for this place from my parents and so , for our anniversary , we booked here . we were told though that it was first come , first served , in terms of having the ideal seats by the windows that overlook the fountains of the bellagio and the strip . we went for lunch though , so it was n't too busy . we were seated by the window and were promptly served some sort of puffed rolls , with cheese and herbs infused . they were delicious !  we ordered the onion soup to start and i ordered parmesan chicken and my husband ordered a lamb burger . our food came and was delicious . the soup was probably my favorite part . we were feeling very full by the end and so declined dessert , but were still given some jellies and chocolate truffle and then were served a small chocolate mousse , on a decorated plate that said happy anniversary , which was a total surprise ( they had asked when i booked if it was a special occasion , but had said nothing while we were there ) . overall the service was great , the food delicious and the view wonderful . it was a great experience !
DOC123 i went here for the first time yesterday night to celebrate something with my family . several members of my family have been to this place before for summerlicious and really enjoyed it .  a nice atmosphere and excellent service , everyone ordered a variety of different dishes , many of which i tasted . i myself had a chicken salad and thought it was very good . my sister 's pasta dish was amazing though ! our waiter never rushed us out and was quick to refill water and bread and clear dishes , etc . that with an arm brace on !  prices are a little high , which is why i did n't give this place five stars ... i know those amazing places exist out there with great food and great prices , but this was a nice evening out .
DOC124 worst experience ever ! i had been there before to get my nails done and the first time was quite good , but the second time was a hot mess . it looked like a five year old did my nails for me . i went home and took the polish off . but this is the kicker : i could n't get an appointment for highlights at my regular salon and this was close by , so i decided to give it a try ( obviously the nail girl would n't be doing my hair ) . i went in and sat down the a woman with an eastern european accent came to talk with me . i showed her a picture of what i wanted and she showed me various hair dye samples ... .none of which looked like my picture , but i always assume the hair dressers know what 's best . now , you 're all thinking , `` ..and she did a poor job and you hated the colour ... '' right ? nope , she told me she could n't do my hair because i had lice ! of course i freaked out . another hair dresser came over to see if i was alright and i was mortified . she asked if i had experienced any itching . i said no . this hairdresser turned back to the original hairdresser and asked if maybe it was n't too bad yet , but original hairdresser said it was really , really bad . i freaked out and left ( obviously without having anything done ) and went to a shoppers and bought lice shampoo . i went home and had my husband look at my hair . he looked and looked and could find nothing . i still did n't want to take chances , so we tore the house apart and washed and bagged everything and i went to a walk-in clinic . the doctor looked at my head and also said there was nothing there ! since i was paranoid , i still used the shampoo and anytime my head itched in the slightest i went to examine it . but even with my husband and mother looking at my head , we never found a single thing . we did n't even see dandruff ! ! i went to a hairdresser a week later and they told me my hair was beautiful ... but dry at the ends ... yeah , because of the chemical-filled lice shampoo ! thanks a lot you crazy woman ! so ultimately , i never had lice . i do n't know if this woman just decided she did n't feel like doing my hair , or if she was delusional , but i sure wo n't be going back there ever again . no one else should either , unless you want to risk being embarrassed and inconvenienced .
DOC125 i love cupcakes . seriously ... .love affair ! so i 'm always on the lookout for new cupcake places . i was in scarborough town centre and came upon this kiosk . it 's not a storefront , but a rather ingenious booth , with colourful signs and a glass showcase full of cupcakes .  there is a long list of flavours and i suspect ( as with many places ) they make different cupcakes for different days .  i ordered 6 , which was $ 18 ... i know , it 's steep , that 's pretty standard . cupcake places seem to range from around the $ 2.25 mark to around $ 4\/cupcake . so these guys fall somewhere inbetween . but not cheap , so i expect excellence , needless to say .  now , here 's the strange thing . on their website each cupcake is listed as $ 2.90 ... .was this the case at the store ? ? i sure hope not . why would you have to pay more for buying more ? maybe it 's an ordering online thing ? anyway , my guess is that you 're paying $ 3\/cupcake at the store , or $ 18 for 6 . no real incentive to buy 6 . but i did , so moving on ... .  of course i chose a range of flavours : oreo cookie . chocolate with vanilla icing , salted caramel , lemon and a double chocolate .  over two days we managed to work our way through them ( myself and my husband ) and i nibbled the different flavours . lemon was my favorite , by far , with the salted caramel being a huge disappointment . it was entirely too salty . more salt than caramel . it was n't very good at all .  but that said , none of the cupcakes really blew me away . and in fact , they were very stale the next day , despite being stored in an airtight container , in the fridge . luckily , the cold buttercream frosting was easy to scoop off and once they had been in the oven for a few minutes , they softened up a bit .  the bottoms of the cupcakes stuck to the wrappers and the flavours were dull tasting and uninspired .  i was also surprised at the lack of creativity in terms of christmas flavours or designed . right before christmas you would expect some special flavours ... maybe a candy cane , or gingerbread cupcake . it would be so easy to switch out one flavour and try to get people to consider your product for a christmas party dessert .  having a little kiosk in a mall is a smart idea . sadly , this business is not one i think i will bother with again !
DOC126 i had a craving for mexican and came here ( ie . yelp ) to figure out what we could do , because there is a very real lack of good mexican food in toronto . this place had some good reviews and was n't too far away from us , so off we went .  parking in leaside can be pretty brutal , but we finally found a space and luckily , street parking is free .  the restaurant is tacky , stereotypical , but cozy and we were quickly greeted and seated .  the menu has basic mexican fare , burritos , fajitas , tacos , with your choice of meat . nothing too outside of the box , but that 's not necessarily a bad thing .  we ordered the guacamole to start and i ordered a chicken enchilada and my husband ordered the chimichanga .  the guacamole is very delicious and creamy , but we had to ask for more nachos and even then it felt like not enough . we were really loading up the chips with the guacamole !  the food came out and the was served with rice , a salad ( sort of italian dressing with feta and tomatoes ) and refried beans . the salad was pretty generic and the rice was bland , but the actual main courses were great and the refried beans helped with the spice ( i 'm a wimp ) .  the appetizer and our main courses came to $ 30 and we were very full .  service was good and food was good and it was n't too expensive . it was n't perfect , but we 'll totally be back !
DOC127 came here with my mother , husband and baby for brunch\/lunch . we were all quite happy with our choice . i think i was the `` winner '' by ordering the french toast . it was practically half a loaf of bread , covered with fruit and with delicious cinnamon butter . my husband ordered the stoney 's breakfast , which is your basic eggs , toast , bacon , etc , meal . my mother ordered the omelet . huge portions , but at around $ 11- $ 13 per breakfast meal , it was on the steep end of brunches and other than mine , i 'm not sure the price is warranted , especially since it 's a order at the counter , then find a seat with your number and wait for your meal type place . people were friendly and service was good ( for what it was ) . i would give it a try if i was in the area again .
DOC128 never eaten at this place before , but it 's always crowded and i decided that must mean something . i was running errands and had n't eaten the whole day , so decided to finally give this place a shot . i ordered a chicken sandwich and iced tea .  the iced tea does n't appear to be iced tea . it was a dark reddish colour and tasted like very watered down pomegranate juice . it was inedible . it was super gross . i was thinking that maybe they made a mistake , but i ca n't see on the menu anything else it might be and the girl who took my order , poured the drink and gave it to me said it was iced tea . sooooo ew .  sandwich was alright , but just alright . the `` aroma sauce '' which is a garlic mayo of sorts was good and the roasted red peppers and mozzerella on the sandwich were good . the bread was good , but the chicken was the sort of cheap , crappy chicken you find at subway , where it 's a sort of compressed chicken-like white meat , with fake grill marks on it . it had no taste and really took away from the overall sandwich .  there are soups , salads and of course hot beverages served at this place as well , so i 'm not writing it off just yet , but this was not a good first impression .
DOC129 solid soup place ... has an ever-so-slightly sketchy vibe to it ... you order your soup and the woman disappears into the back ... usually closes the sliding window so you ca n't see back there and then eventually emerges with your soup . also seems to sell a selection of jamaican movies in dvd from a glass case ... sort of random .  generous with the veggies , less so with dumplings , but all the soups have great flavour and are decently sized for the price . i wish they would offer some bread or crackers for the soup ... would be a nice , easy add-on . but this place is what it is and does n't bother with the bells and whistles . really deserves a 3.5 stars . the red bean is my fav by far .
DOC130 i would be more inclined to give this place 3-1\/2 stars , but since that 's not possible , i 'm rounding down .  i went here for sunday lunch with a group for winterlicious . for $ 15 we got a choice of appetizer , entree and dessert .  we arrived first and our table was waiting for us . the restaurant was not busy at that point and our waiter was very attentive with water and the wine menu .  once our party finally arrived we all ordered . i had their chipotle sweet potato & goat cheese dip , which was average . the salads looked much better and got better reviews . same with the soup . the dip was literally a dollap of dip at the side of the plate with some crostinis on the other end and 1 piece of pickled cauliflower and a few slices of onion in the middle . the dip was good , the pickled cauliflower alright . it was nice when all combined on the crostini ( pickled veggies , dip on top of crostini ) .  i had originally wanted to order the double pork slider , but i saw it arrive at someone else 's table and it was literally just the one , single mini pork sandwich , with a few thinly cut fries at the side . it looked good , but it was appetizer size , if that . the chicken sandwich was more reasonably sized , so i ordered that . it was good . i really liked the bread . the macaroni was also more reasonably sized . i sampled it and it was fine . did n't blow me away .  dessert was the highlight of the meal for everyone i think . some people ordered the mousse , which i thought was fine , but the people who ordered it loved , so there you have it . my husband loved his apple terrine , which i tried and was good . i liked the flavour of my creme brule very much , but the top was over toasted and had hardened to the consistency of a thin , hard candy . it was hard to break with my spoon and got stuck in my teeth .  the service was consistently good , so no complaints there . none of us had wine with our lunch ( although some had other drinks ) , so i ca n't comment there .  this is a tapas bar , so i expect sizes to be small . but when sizes are small i expect them to be priced accordingly and\/or to be in sharable portions . they gave the prices of each dish if you were to purchased them individually . these would all be hard to share and would n't really be worth it . they are nice as a winterlicious meal , but i 'm not sure this would be my first choice to go back to .
DOC131 i am surprised at the people complaining about the service , because we found the service to be fine . especially given how busy and cramped it was . there were no tables , but they got us seats at the bar . the music was maybe a little loud , but i enjoyed the 90s throwback that was happening . the place looks like a dive , it 's a total hole in the wall , with no signs to speak of , but i liked the weird atmosphere of weird , old `` ghetto blasters '' on the walls and pics of arnold in terminator . it 's random , just go with it ... but the food ... .oh the food ! we were told that the squash poutine was a must have , so i ordered that and the bulgogi cheese steak , while my friend ordered the poutine and the mackerel . the mackerel was served first . it arrived raw , on a platter and a torch was taken to it to sear the outside and that was it . my friend allowed me a bite and it was so fresh tasting , with a delicious marinade . next came by bulgogi sandwich . fresh , delicious bread and amazing bulgogi . was very pleased . finally the `` poutines '' arrived . i should say that it was not what we were expecting . i assumed it would be squash on top of fries . but in fact the squash was the fries . they were lightly fried and covered in a variety of sauce `` gravies '' and scallions and some other stuff that i could neither make out , nor even see clearly ( dim lighting ) . it does n't matter okay ... .this stuff was heaven ! both my friend and i took a bite and looked at each other ... and proclaimed our new favourite food . other people in our party got the wings , which looked amazing and they said they were and the loosey , which was also proclaimed as delicious . so basically there were no wrong moves . the drink menu was very adventurous ... more so than we were , because we did n't take the plunge , although it was fun sitting at the bar and watching the bartender creating them . and splitting the bill for my friend with two others ( her birthday ) , my two `` tapas '' and a generic alcoholic beverage came to just under $ 30 . the prices are extremely reasonable ... and honestly once you try this stuff ... i mean , i do n't want to give them any ideas , but i would have paid more for that fine , fine food . i will be back . need me some more of that poutine !
DOC132 our friends got the groupon for four people and took us along . i 'm very pleased we went ! having never had ethiopian food before , we were curious , but wary . the deal really helped us dive in . it included two appetizers , four main courses and two desserts . we started with two appetizers , one i was n't a huge fan of ( a `` salad '' with a strong vinegar taste and jalapenos , which i found too strong , although other people in my group really liked it ) . the other appetizer was similar to an indian samosa ( similar name too , but i ca n't remember exactly what it was called ) . they were stuff with lentils and had a flaky shell . they were delicious . but , their appetizers were only made for three people , so there were only three of them ! seems silly when you offer a four person deal . we each ordered a different main course and they brought them on one large platter , so we could all share . we ordered two vegetarian options , one of lentils and one of chickpeas and one of chicken and one of beef . basically , the meals are more sauces than anything and they are served with injera , which are sort of bland , cold , bread-like stuff , which comes rolled up . they 're nothing special , but they 're only used as a sort of utensil , because you use it to scoop up the food . the food was delicious ! i especially liked the chickpea dish . every one of us ended up liking a different dish the best ! worked out well . i personally found the beef dish very tough though . once we were stuff with the food , we ordered two desserts . we especially liked the cheesecake ( which is obviously not ethiopian ) . we asked if they had any ethiopian coffees and they said yes . they showed us the beans , as they were being roasted . then they came back out with a sort of stone earthenware kettle and some small cups . the coffee was so rich , it was almost like chocolate . they also served it with a large basket of popcorn , which was just perfectly prepared . it was such a nice after dinner snack ! i would totally come here just to order the coffee ! it would have been a very expensive dinner without the groupon , so i 'm not sure i would make this a regularly destination , but as i said , the coffee was fantastic and it 's a fun thing to try , especially with friends . make sure they 're good ones , that you do n't mind getting messy in front of !
DOC133 a little on the pricey end for baked goods , but the baked goods are good . also their coffee products are great . the set up is annoying ( order your desserts on one side and coffee and food on another side ) , but the service is good and overall they do a good job .
DOC134 my sister told me that origin was well known for their delicious brunches , so we made a trip there to see if this was the case . origin is pretty new in our area and is very large , but nicely decorated . my only comment would be the washrooms , which feature communal sinks , the kind you find in elementary schools , where you step on the thing at the bottom and water comes out all around . besides not being very effective to quickly wash hands , it 's also wasteful if you 're the only one there . strange concept . throw back , but not necessarily one wants to remember during their brunch . now onto the important part ... the food and service . service started out alright and then immediately got very slow . it took some time to get our drink orders and then took a long time to get our actual orders . i ordered their french toast , my sister ordered tostada and my husband skipped brunch and ordered a meal they offered of a burger , fries covered in some chorizo and sauce and a float . i also ordered a side of bacon ... and was told that they were out of bacon ... which meant any orders that would have come with bacon were out entirely , or would be served without bacon . i 'm sorry but a brunch restaurant without bacon ? even the waitress admitted it was ridiculous . we also shared a plate of buscuits with their preserves . these were delicious . apparently my meal was the one that took the longest . the others got their food and we still waited for five minutes before mine came out . who knew it would take so long to put a couple of pieces of bread on a plate and cover them with blueberry preserves ? my sister said her tostada was quite good . my french toast was nothing special . the toast was `` fancy '' , rounded pieces , on top of each other with whipped cream and blueberries in between . the `` maple '' which was supposed to be on the plate ( maple syrup i 'm guessing ) was barely present . tasted like something i could have created with some ease . my husband 's dish was the best by far . his burger was juicy and this fries were great . the float was a little silly ... this big , meaty burger and fries covered in more meat ... paired with a cream soda float in pink and white layers . ( not insulting , we just got a laugh ) . nothing was cheap and then we had to wait a long time again to get our bill and pay . this was all strange because the restaurant was not particularly busy . because the brunch itself did n't blow me away , food shortages and service , i 'm not sure if i would bother with brunch again . oliver and bonicini in the actual mall has a much better brunch . i might try this again for lunch or dinner though .
DOC135 the saga has finished ... .because i needed to end this bs and move on .  so first off , the store owner responded to my complaints ... by blaming me . apparently it is my fault they sent the wrong thing , because i sent an email and then followed it up with a phone call ... which confused them and made them think there were two orders or something . which makes zero sense , because two orders were not sent . and the person i was speaking with on the phone responded to the emails i sent with codes to try out ... .so i have a hard time believing that they were confused by what was going on and thought that the phone order and email order were different .  they also told me they blocked me on instagram because i was body shaming their models . i want to be very clear on this . i never once body shamed , or made any comments on instagram about their models . i asked why they were promoting clothing they do n't even have in stock on instagram ... apparently that equates to body shaming to them .  they also informed me that because they had to mail so many orders to me ( 3 ) , they were going to start to charge me for shipping . they seemed to forget that i had also been paying to ship items back to them and that i had specifically chosen times when they had free shipping promos taking place to place orders . it 's not that they were n't charging me for shipping ... it was that i was taking advantage of their own promos . apparently i ca n't use their promos anymore , because they have placed an arbitrary rules on how many times you can make a return now . at least for me .  they did not address the code not working .  i responded and expressed continued frustration at their lack of ownership over their mistakes and how poor their customer service continued to be .  then i did some research and sent another email . instead of returning the dress i would donate it to dress for success . i said this seemed like a better choice than continuing to mail clothing back and forth . my request to them was that they take the would be money they would spend on continuing to mail me clothing and take some ownership for their mistakes and channel it into something good . i asked that they take the remaining $ 9.98 credit i had and put it towards them making a small donation , either monetarily or a piece of clothing , also to the charity . i stated that their continued neglect for customer service and lack of ownership over repeated problems should be owned up to , but if they would n't do it for me , perhaps they would be willing to do so for someone in need . i said that would conclude our business and bring something good out of this ridiculousness .  a few hours later i received an email with a letter of thanks for a donation made to dress for success ... for the amount of $ 10 via the store ... .so my remainder amount i had paid for and big sis closet 's contribution of ... .two cents . their generosity is astounding . now , i do n't know that they have n't made their own donation and just not told me of course ... i 'll let you guys decide whether you want to give them the benefit of the doubt in that regard . but given that they have taken zero responsibility for the continued poor management and customer service , well ... i think you can guess what my thoughts are on the subject . no further correspondence was sent from the actual store .  but at any rate , i am donating the new dress to dress for success ( along with my $ 9.98 ) and i am officially done with this store for good . and i sincerely hope that people read this review and think twice about shopping here . the clothes are not good quality , but more than that ... i have never experienced such insanely bad management and customer service in my life . zero regard for their customers , zero regard for their own mistakes , zero regard for taking ownership of ... anything ! just excuse after excuse and then turning the blame around on their customers . these people do not deserve your business and quite frankly ... ladies you deserve better . better clothing ( i have now purchased 6 items and been dissatisfied with the quality of all of them ... loose threads , flimsy , cheap fabric , wrong stitching for the fabric , no lining , incorrect fit for size , etc . ) and a greater degree of respect as a consumer .
DOC136 went here with my sister and her boyfriend for some drinks . we were hungry and ordered a few appetizers to share . drinks were fine ( my mix drink was on the very small side ) , but the food was really good . the perogies and `` chips '' and dip were excellent . the service was good and the atmosphere was nice , for such a small place . bathrooms were also nice , clean , etc . only problem is that some of the tables are so small , it 's really hard to use them . we were at a very small one and even though we fit around it alright , a guy walking by knocked a beer over with his coat and it dumped all down me . i mean all over me . it 's not the bar 's fault the guy knocked the glass , but if the table was a bit bigger we would have had more room to put the glass further in , so it would n't have gotten knocked in the first place . the fact is , if you 're going to serve food people need a place to put it . a few slightly bigger tables would go a long way .

DOC126 i had a craving for mexican and came here ( ie . yelp ) to figure out what we could do , because there is a very real lack of good mexican food in toronto . this place had some good reviews and was n't too far away from us , so off we went .  parking in leaside can be pretty brutal , but we finally found a space and luckily , street parking is free .  the restaurant is tacky , stereotypical , but cozy and we were quickly greeted and seated .  the menu has basic mexican fare , burritos , fajitas , tacos , with your choice of meat . nothing too outside of the box , but that 's not necessarily a bad thing .  we ordered the guacamole to start and i ordered a chicken enchilada and my husband ordered the chimichanga .  the guacamole is very delicious and creamy , but we had to ask for more nachos and even then it felt like not enough . we were really loading up the chips with the guacamole !  the food came out and the was served with rice , a salad ( sort of italian dressing with feta and tomatoes ) and refried beans . the salad was pretty generic and the rice was bland , but the actual main courses were great and the refried beans helped with the spice ( i 'm a wimp ) .  the appetizer and our main courses came to $ 30 and we were very full .  service was good and food was good and it was n't too expensive . it was n't perfect , but we 'll totally be back !
DOC127 came here with my mother , husband and baby for brunch\/lunch . we were all quite happy with our choice . i think i was the `` winner '' by ordering the french toast . it was practically half a loaf of bread , covered with fruit and with delicious cinnamon butter . my husband ordered the stoney 's breakfast , which is your basic eggs , toast , bacon , etc , meal . my mother ordered the omelet . huge portions , but at around $ 11- $ 13 per breakfast meal , it was on the steep end of brunches and other than mine , i 'm not sure the price is warranted , especially since it 's a order at the counter , then find a seat with your number and wait for your meal type place . people were friendly and service was good ( for what it was ) . i would give it a try if i was in the area again .
DOC128 never eaten at this place before , but it 's always crowded and i decided that must mean something . i was running errands and had n't eaten the whole day , so decided to finally give this place a shot . i ordered a chicken sandwich and iced tea .  the iced tea does n't appear to be iced tea . it was a dark reddish colour and tasted like very watered down pomegranate juice . it was inedible . it was super gross . i was thinking that maybe they made a mistake , but i ca n't see on the menu anything else it might be and the girl who took my order , poured the drink and gave it to me said it was iced tea . sooooo ew .  sandwich was alright , but just alright . the `` aroma sauce '' which is a garlic mayo of sorts was good and the roasted red peppers and mozzerella on the sandwich were good . the bread was good , but the chicken was the sort of cheap , crappy chicken you find at subway , where it 's a sort of compressed chicken-like white meat , with fake grill marks on it . it had no taste and really took away from the overall sandwich .  there are soups , salads and of course hot beverages served at this place as well , so i 'm not writing it off just yet , but this was not a good first impression .
DOC129 solid soup place ... has an ever-so-slightly sketchy vibe to it ... you order your soup and the woman disappears into the back ... usually closes the sliding window so you ca n't see back there and then eventually emerges with your soup . also seems to sell a selection of jamaican movies in dvd from a glass case ... sort of random .  generous with the veggies , less so with dumplings , but all the soups have great flavour and are decently sized for the price . i wish they would offer some bread or crackers for the soup ... would be a nice , easy add-on . but this place is what it is and does n't bother with the bells and whistles . really deserves a 3.5 stars . the red bean is my fav by far .
DOC130 i would be more inclined to give this place 3-1\/2 stars , but since that 's not possible , i 'm rounding down .  i went here for sunday lunch with a group for winterlicious . for $ 15 we got a choice of appetizer , entree and dessert .  we arrived first and our table was waiting for us . the restaurant was not busy at that point and our waiter was very attentive with water and the wine menu .  once our party finally arrived we all ordered . i had their chipotle sweet potato & goat cheese dip , which was average . the salads looked much better and got better reviews . same with the soup . the dip was literally a dollap of dip at the side of the plate with some crostinis on the other end and 1 piece of pickled cauliflower and a few slices of onion in the middle . the dip was good , the pickled cauliflower alright . it was nice when all combined on the crostini ( pickled veggies , dip on top of crostini ) .  i had originally wanted to order the double pork slider , but i saw it arrive at someone else 's table and it was literally just the one , single mini pork sandwich , with a few thinly cut fries at the side . it looked good , but it was appetizer size , if that . the chicken sandwich was more reasonably sized , so i ordered that . it was good . i really liked the bread . the macaroni was also more reasonably sized . i sampled it and it was fine . did n't blow me away .  dessert was the highlight of the meal for everyone i think . some people ordered the mousse , which i thought was fine , but the people who ordered it loved , so there you have it . my husband loved his apple terrine , which i tried and was good . i liked the flavour of my creme brule very much , but the top was over toasted and had hardened to the consistency of a thin , hard candy . it was hard to break with my spoon and got stuck in my teeth .  the service was consistently good , so no complaints there . none of us had wine with our lunch ( although some had other drinks ) , so i ca n't comment there .  this is a tapas bar , so i expect sizes to be small . but when sizes are small i expect them to be priced accordingly and\/or to be in sharable portions . they gave the prices of each dish if you were to purchased them individually . these would all be hard to share and would n't really be worth it . they are nice as a winterlicious meal , but i 'm not sure this would be my first choice to go back to .
DOC131 i am surprised at the people complaining about the service , because we found the service to be fine . especially given how busy and cramped it was . there were no tables , but they got us seats at the bar . the music was maybe a little loud , but i enjoyed the 90s throwback that was happening . the place looks like a dive , it 's a total hole in the wall , with no signs to speak of , but i liked the weird atmosphere of weird , old `` ghetto blasters '' on the walls and pics of arnold in terminator . it 's random , just go with it ... but the food ... .oh the food ! we were told that the squash poutine was a must have , so i ordered that and the bulgogi cheese steak , while my friend ordered the poutine and the mackerel . the mackerel was served first . it arrived raw , on a platter and a torch was taken to it to sear the outside and that was it . my friend allowed me a bite and it was so fresh tasting , with a delicious marinade . next came by bulgogi sandwich . fresh , delicious bread and amazing bulgogi . was very pleased . finally the `` poutines '' arrived . i should say that it was not what we were expecting . i assumed it would be squash on top of fries . but in fact the squash was the fries . they were lightly fried and covered in a variety of sauce `` gravies '' and scallions and some other stuff that i could neither make out , nor even see clearly ( dim lighting ) . it does n't matter okay ... .this stuff was heaven ! both my friend and i took a bite and looked at each other ... and proclaimed our new favourite food . other people in our party got the wings , which looked amazing and they said they were and the loosey , which was also proclaimed as delicious . so basically there were no wrong moves . the drink menu was very adventurous ... more so than we were , because we did n't take the plunge , although it was fun sitting at the bar and watching the bartender creating them . and splitting the bill for my friend with two others ( her birthday ) , my two `` tapas '' and a generic alcoholic beverage came to just under $ 30 . the prices are extremely reasonable ... and honestly once you try this stuff ... i mean , i do n't want to give them any ideas , but i would have paid more for that fine , fine food . i will be back . need me some more of that poutine !
DOC132 our friends got the groupon for four people and took us along . i 'm very pleased we went ! having never had ethiopian food before , we were curious , but wary . the deal really helped us dive in . it included two appetizers , four main courses and two desserts . we started with two appetizers , one i was n't a huge fan of ( a `` salad '' with a strong vinegar taste and jalapenos , which i found too strong , although other people in my group really liked it ) . the other appetizer was similar to an indian samosa ( similar name too , but i ca n't remember exactly what it was called ) . they were stuff with lentils and had a flaky shell . they were delicious . but , their appetizers were only made for three people , so there were only three of them ! seems silly when you offer a four person deal . we each ordered a different main course and they brought them on one large platter , so we could all share . we ordered two vegetarian options , one of lentils and one of chickpeas and one of chicken and one of beef . basically , the meals are more sauces than anything and they are served with injera , which are sort of bland , cold , bread-like stuff , which comes rolled up . they 're nothing special , but they 're only used as a sort of utensil , because you use it to scoop up the food . the food was delicious ! i especially liked the chickpea dish . every one of us ended up liking a different dish the best ! worked out well . i personally found the beef dish very tough though . once we were stuff with the food , we ordered two desserts . we especially liked the cheesecake ( which is obviously not ethiopian ) . we asked if they had any ethiopian coffees and they said yes . they showed us the beans , as they were being roasted . then they came back out with a sort of stone earthenware kettle and some small cups . the coffee was so rich , it was almost like chocolate . they also served it with a large basket of popcorn , which was just perfectly prepared . it was such a nice after dinner snack ! i would totally come here just to order the coffee ! it would have been a very expensive dinner without the groupon , so i 'm not sure i would make this a regularly destination , but as i said , the coffee was fantastic and it 's a fun thing to try , especially with friends . make sure they 're good ones , that you do n't mind getting messy in front of !
DOC133 a little on the pricey end for baked goods , but the baked goods are good . also their coffee products are great . the set up is annoying ( order your desserts on one side and coffee and food on another side ) , but the service is good and overall they do a good job .
DOC134 my sister told me that origin was well known for their delicious brunches , so we made a trip there to see if this was the case . origin is pretty new in our area and is very large , but nicely decorated . my only comment would be the washrooms , which feature communal sinks , the kind you find in elementary schools , where you step on the thing at the bottom and water comes out all around . besides not being very effective to quickly wash hands , it 's also wasteful if you 're the only one there . strange concept . throw back , but not necessarily one wants to remember during their brunch . now onto the important part ... the food and service . service started out alright and then immediately got very slow . it took some time to get our drink orders and then took a long time to get our actual orders . i ordered their french toast , my sister ordered tostada and my husband skipped brunch and ordered a meal they offered of a burger , fries covered in some chorizo and sauce and a float . i also ordered a side of bacon ... and was told that they were out of bacon ... which meant any orders that would have come with bacon were out entirely , or would be served without bacon . i 'm sorry but a brunch restaurant without bacon ? even the waitress admitted it was ridiculous . we also shared a plate of buscuits with their preserves . these were delicious . apparently my meal was the one that took the longest . the others got their food and we still waited for five minutes before mine came out . who knew it would take so long to put a couple of pieces of bread on a plate and cover them with blueberry preserves ? my sister said her tostada was quite good . my french toast was nothing special . the toast was `` fancy '' , rounded pieces , on top of each other with whipped cream and blueberries in between . the `` maple '' which was supposed to be on the plate ( maple syrup i 'm guessing ) was barely present . tasted like something i could have created with some ease . my husband 's dish was the best by far . his burger was juicy and this fries were great . the float was a little silly ... this big , meaty burger and fries covered in more meat ... paired with a cream soda float in pink and white layers . ( not insulting , we just got a laugh ) . nothing was cheap and then we had to wait a long time again to get our bill and pay . this was all strange because the restaurant was not particularly busy . because the brunch itself did n't blow me away , food shortages and service , i 'm not sure if i would bother with brunch again . oliver and bonicini in the actual mall has a much better brunch . i might try this again for lunch or dinner though .
DOC135 the saga has finished ... .because i needed to end this bs and move on .  so first off , the store owner responded to my complaints ... by blaming me . apparently it is my fault they sent the wrong thing , because i sent an email and then followed it up with a phone call ... which confused them and made them think there were two orders or something . which makes zero sense , because two orders were not sent . and the person i was speaking with on the phone responded to the emails i sent with codes to try out ... .so i have a hard time believing that they were confused by what was going on and thought that the phone order and email order were different .  they also told me they blocked me on instagram because i was body shaming their models . i want to be very clear on this . i never once body shamed , or made any comments on instagram about their models . i asked why they were promoting clothing they do n't even have in stock on instagram ... apparently that equates to body shaming to them .  they also informed me that because they had to mail so many orders to me ( 3 ) , they were going to start to charge me for shipping . they seemed to forget that i had also been paying to ship items back to them and that i had specifically chosen times when they had free shipping promos taking place to place orders . it 's not that they were n't charging me for shipping ... it was that i was taking advantage of their own promos . apparently i ca n't use their promos anymore , because they have placed an arbitrary rules on how many times you can make a return now . at least for me .  they did not address the code not working .  i responded and expressed continued frustration at their lack of ownership over their mistakes and how poor their customer service continued to be .  then i did some research and sent another email . instead of returning the dress i would donate it to dress for success . i said this seemed like a better choice than continuing to mail clothing back and forth . my request to them was that they take the would be money they would spend on continuing to mail me clothing and take some ownership for their mistakes and channel it into something good . i asked that they take the remaining $ 9.98 credit i had and put it towards them making a small donation , either monetarily or a piece of clothing , also to the charity . i stated that their continued neglect for customer service and lack of ownership over repeated problems should be owned up to , but if they would n't do it for me , perhaps they would be willing to do so for someone in need . i said that would conclude our business and bring something good out of this ridiculousness .  a few hours later i received an email with a letter of thanks for a donation made to dress for success ... for the amount of $ 10 via the store ... .so my remainder amount i had paid for and big sis closet 's contribution of ... .two cents . their generosity is astounding . now , i do n't know that they have n't made their own donation and just not told me of course ... i 'll let you guys decide whether you want to give them the benefit of the doubt in that regard . but given that they have taken zero responsibility for the continued poor management and customer service , well ... i think you can guess what my thoughts are on the subject . no further correspondence was sent from the actual store .  but at any rate , i am donating the new dress to dress for success ( along with my $ 9.98 ) and i am officially done with this store for good . and i sincerely hope that people read this review and think twice about shopping here . the clothes are not good quality , but more than that ... i have never experienced such insanely bad management and customer service in my life . zero regard for their customers , zero regard for their own mistakes , zero regard for taking ownership of ... anything ! just excuse after excuse and then turning the blame around on their customers . these people do not deserve your business and quite frankly ... ladies you deserve better . better clothing ( i have now purchased 6 items and been dissatisfied with the quality of all of them ... loose threads , flimsy , cheap fabric , wrong stitching for the fabric , no lining , incorrect fit for size , etc . ) and a greater degree of respect as a consumer .
DOC136 went here with my sister and her boyfriend for some drinks . we were hungry and ordered a few appetizers to share . drinks were fine ( my mix drink was on the very small side ) , but the food was really good . the perogies and `` chips '' and dip were excellent . the service was good and the atmosphere was nice , for such a small place . bathrooms were also nice , clean , etc . only problem is that some of the tables are so small , it 's really hard to use them . we were at a very small one and even though we fit around it alright , a guy walking by knocked a beer over with his coat and it dumped all down me . i mean all over me . it 's not the bar 's fault the guy knocked the glass , but if the table was a bit bigger we would have had more room to put the glass further in , so it would n't have gotten knocked in the first place . the fact is , if you 're going to serve food people need a place to put it . a few slightly bigger tables would go a long way .
DOC121 after being scared away from rock & rita 's , we ended up at this place , which was , if nothing else , quieter .  i 'll start by saying that the hostess and our server were both lovely and they 're really what earned the single star , because they were sweet , but the food was just horrible .  i ordered a simple grilled cheese sandwich . i asked the server if it was processed cheese , or `` real '' cheese in the sandwich and he had no idea what i was talking about . i tried to clarify by saying , `` is it like kraft single slices , or deli cheese ? '' he said it was `` good '' . this really should have been a sign and i could probably fault the waiter for this , since you should know what you 're serving , but he was so sweet , i could n't be mad !  my husband ordered a hot dog of sorts .  i asked if there was a way to substitute fries for a salad . there was not , but the server hooked me up and brought me a salad anyway ( no charge ) . i asked for sweet potato fries with the sandwich .  of course , my sandwich was made with plasticy , processed cheese , that was melted to the point of cheeze-wiz and was inedible . i took one bite of the sandwich and could n't do another . i got regular fries , instead of sweet potato ( did n't bother complaining , because i got the free salad , so whatever ... like i said , nice server ! ) my husband 's food was fine , although nothing special . they were good with the refills of our drinks .  anyway , as nice as the servers were , it was n't good . i would avoid eating here if i could .
DOC122 we got recommendations for this place from my parents and so , for our anniversary , we booked here . we were told though that it was first come , first served , in terms of having the ideal seats by the windows that overlook the fountains of the bellagio and the strip . we went for lunch though , so it was n't too busy . we were seated by the window and were promptly served some sort of puffed rolls , with cheese and herbs infused . they were delicious !  we ordered the onion soup to start and i ordered parmesan chicken and my husband ordered a lamb burger . our food came and was delicious . the soup was probably my favorite part . we were feeling very full by the end and so declined dessert , but were still given some jellies and chocolate truffle and then were served a small chocolate mousse , on a decorated plate that said happy anniversary , which was a total surprise ( they had asked when i booked if it was a special occasion , but had said nothing while we were there ) . overall the service was great , the food delicious and the view wonderful . it was a great experience !
DOC123 i went here for the first time yesterday night to celebrate something with my family . several members of my family have been to this place before for summerlicious and really enjoyed it .  a nice atmosphere and excellent service , everyone ordered a variety of different dishes , many of which i tasted . i myself had a chicken salad and thought it was very good . my sister 's pasta dish was amazing though ! our waiter never rushed us out and was quick to refill water and bread and clear dishes , etc . that with an arm brace on !  prices are a little high , which is why i did n't give this place five stars ... i know those amazing places exist out there with great food and great prices , but this was a nice evening out .
DOC124 worst experience ever ! i had been there before to get my nails done and the first time was quite good , but the second time was a hot mess . it looked like a five year old did my nails for me . i went home and took the polish off . but this is the kicker : i could n't get an appointment for highlights at my regular salon and this was close by , so i decided to give it a try ( obviously the nail girl would n't be doing my hair ) . i went in and sat down the a woman with an eastern european accent came to talk with me . i showed her a picture of what i wanted and she showed me various hair dye samples ... .none of which looked like my picture , but i always assume the hair dressers know what 's best . now , you 're all thinking , `` ..and she did a poor job and you hated the colour ... '' right ? nope , she told me she could n't do my hair because i had lice ! of course i freaked out . another hair dresser came over to see if i was alright and i was mortified . she asked if i had experienced any itching . i said no . this hairdresser turned back to the original hairdresser and asked if maybe it was n't too bad yet , but original hairdresser said it was really , really bad . i freaked out and left ( obviously without having anything done ) and went to a shoppers and bought lice shampoo . i went home and had my husband look at my hair . he looked and looked and could find nothing . i still did n't want to take chances , so we tore the house apart and washed and bagged everything and i went to a walk-in clinic . the doctor looked at my head and also said there was nothing there ! since i was paranoid , i still used the shampoo and anytime my head itched in the slightest i went to examine it . but even with my husband and mother looking at my head , we never found a single thing . we did n't even see dandruff ! ! i went to a hairdresser a week later and they told me my hair was beautiful ... but dry at the ends ... yeah , because of the chemical-filled lice shampoo ! thanks a lot you crazy woman ! so ultimately , i never had lice . i do n't know if this woman just decided she did n't feel like doing my hair , or if she was delusional , but i sure wo n't be going back there ever again . no one else should either , unless you want to risk being embarrassed and inconvenienced .

DOC130 i would be more inclined to give this place 3-1\/2 stars , but since that 's not possible , i 'm rounding down .  i went here for sunday lunch with a group for winterlicious . for $ 15 we got a choice of appetizer , entree and dessert .  we arrived first and our table was waiting for us . the restaurant was not busy at that point and our waiter was very attentive with water and the wine menu .  once our party finally arrived we all ordered . i had their chipotle sweet potato & goat cheese dip , which was average . the salads looked much better and got better reviews . same with the soup . the dip was literally a dollap of dip at the side of the plate with some crostinis on the other end and 1 piece of pickled cauliflower and a few slices of onion in the middle . the dip was good , the pickled cauliflower alright . it was nice when all combined on the crostini ( pickled veggies , dip on top of crostini ) .  i had originally wanted to order the double pork slider , but i saw it arrive at someone else 's table and it was literally just the one , single mini pork sandwich , with a few thinly cut fries at the side . it looked good , but it was appetizer size , if that . the chicken sandwich was more reasonably sized , so i ordered that . it was good . i really liked the bread . the macaroni was also more reasonably sized . i sampled it and it was fine . did n't blow me away .  dessert was the highlight of the meal for everyone i think . some people ordered the mousse , which i thought was fine , but the people who ordered it loved , so there you have it . my husband loved his apple terrine , which i tried and was good . i liked the flavour of my creme brule very much , but the top was over toasted and had hardened to the consistency of a thin , hard candy . it was hard to break with my spoon and got stuck in my teeth .  the service was consistently good , so no complaints there . none of us had wine with our lunch ( although some had other drinks ) , so i ca n't comment there .  this is a tapas bar , so i expect sizes to be small . but when sizes are small i expect them to be priced accordingly and\/or to be in sharable portions . they gave the prices of each dish if you were to purchased them individually . these would all be hard to share and would n't really be worth it . they are nice as a winterlicious meal , but i 'm not sure this would be my first choice to go back to .
DOC121 after being scared away from rock & rita 's , we ended up at this place , which was , if nothing else , quieter .  i 'll start by saying that the hostess and our server were both lovely and they 're really what earned the single star , because they were sweet , but the food was just horrible .  i ordered a simple grilled cheese sandwich . i asked the server if it was processed cheese , or `` real '' cheese in the sandwich and he had no idea what i was talking about . i tried to clarify by saying , `` is it like kraft single slices , or deli cheese ? '' he said it was `` good '' . this really should have been a sign and i could probably fault the waiter for this , since you should know what you 're serving , but he was so sweet , i could n't be mad !  my husband ordered a hot dog of sorts .  i asked if there was a way to substitute fries for a salad . there was not , but the server hooked me up and brought me a salad anyway ( no charge ) . i asked for sweet potato fries with the sandwich .  of course , my sandwich was made with plasticy , processed cheese , that was melted to the point of cheeze-wiz and was inedible . i took one bite of the sandwich and could n't do another . i got regular fries , instead of sweet potato ( did n't bother complaining , because i got the free salad , so whatever ... like i said , nice server ! ) my husband 's food was fine , although nothing special . they were good with the refills of our drinks .  anyway , as nice as the servers were , it was n't good . i would avoid eating here if i could .
DOC122 we got recommendations for this place from my parents and so , for our anniversary , we booked here . we were told though that it was first come , first served , in terms of having the ideal seats by the windows that overlook the fountains of the bellagio and the strip . we went for lunch though , so it was n't too busy . we were seated by the window and were promptly served some sort of puffed rolls , with cheese and herbs infused . they were delicious !  we ordered the onion soup to start and i ordered parmesan chicken and my husband ordered a lamb burger . our food came and was delicious . the soup was probably my favorite part . we were feeling very full by the end and so declined dessert , but were still given some jellies and chocolate truffle and then were served a small chocolate mousse , on a decorated plate that said happy anniversary , which was a total surprise ( they had asked when i booked if it was a special occasion , but had said nothing while we were there ) . overall the service was great , the food delicious and the view wonderful . it was a great experience !
DOC123 i went here for the first time yesterday night to celebrate something with my family . several members of my family have been to this place before for summerlicious and really enjoyed it .  a nice atmosphere and excellent service , everyone ordered a variety of different dishes , many of which i tasted . i myself had a chicken salad and thought it was very good . my sister 's pasta dish was amazing though ! our waiter never rushed us out and was quick to refill water and bread and clear dishes , etc . that with an arm brace on !  prices are a little high , which is why i did n't give this place five stars ... i know those amazing places exist out there with great food and great prices , but this was a nice evening out .
DOC124 worst experience ever ! i had been there before to get my nails done and the first time was quite good , but the second time was a hot mess . it looked like a five year old did my nails for me . i went home and took the polish off . but this is the kicker : i could n't get an appointment for highlights at my regular salon and this was close by , so i decided to give it a try ( obviously the nail girl would n't be doing my hair ) . i went in and sat down the a woman with an eastern european accent came to talk with me . i showed her a picture of what i wanted and she showed me various hair dye samples ... .none of which looked like my picture , but i always assume the hair dressers know what 's best . now , you 're all thinking , `` ..and she did a poor job and you hated the colour ... '' right ? nope , she told me she could n't do my hair because i had lice ! of course i freaked out . another hair dresser came over to see if i was alright and i was mortified . she asked if i had experienced any itching . i said no . this hairdresser turned back to the original hairdresser and asked if maybe it was n't too bad yet , but original hairdresser said it was really , really bad . i freaked out and left ( obviously without having anything done ) and went to a shoppers and bought lice shampoo . i went home and had my husband look at my hair . he looked and looked and could find nothing . i still did n't want to take chances , so we tore the house apart and washed and bagged everything and i went to a walk-in clinic . the doctor looked at my head and also said there was nothing there ! since i was paranoid , i still used the shampoo and anytime my head itched in the slightest i went to examine it . but even with my husband and mother looking at my head , we never found a single thing . we did n't even see dandruff ! ! i went to a hairdresser a week later and they told me my hair was beautiful ... but dry at the ends ... yeah , because of the chemical-filled lice shampoo ! thanks a lot you crazy woman ! so ultimately , i never had lice . i do n't know if this woman just decided she did n't feel like doing my hair , or if she was delusional , but i sure wo n't be going back there ever again . no one else should either , unless you want to risk being embarrassed and inconvenienced .
DOC125 i love cupcakes . seriously ... .love affair ! so i 'm always on the lookout for new cupcake places . i was in scarborough town centre and came upon this kiosk . it 's not a storefront , but a rather ingenious booth , with colourful signs and a glass showcase full of cupcakes .  there is a long list of flavours and i suspect ( as with many places ) they make different cupcakes for different days .  i ordered 6 , which was $ 18 ... i know , it 's steep , that 's pretty standard . cupcake places seem to range from around the $ 2.25 mark to around $ 4\/cupcake . so these guys fall somewhere inbetween . but not cheap , so i expect excellence , needless to say .  now , here 's the strange thing . on their website each cupcake is listed as $ 2.90 ... .was this the case at the store ? ? i sure hope not . why would you have to pay more for buying more ? maybe it 's an ordering online thing ? anyway , my guess is that you 're paying $ 3\/cupcake at the store , or $ 18 for 6 . no real incentive to buy 6 . but i did , so moving on ... .  of course i chose a range of flavours : oreo cookie . chocolate with vanilla icing , salted caramel , lemon and a double chocolate .  over two days we managed to work our way through them ( myself and my husband ) and i nibbled the different flavours . lemon was my favorite , by far , with the salted caramel being a huge disappointment . it was entirely too salty . more salt than caramel . it was n't very good at all .  but that said , none of the cupcakes really blew me away . and in fact , they were very stale the next day , despite being stored in an airtight container , in the fridge . luckily , the cold buttercream frosting was easy to scoop off and once they had been in the oven for a few minutes , they softened up a bit .  the bottoms of the cupcakes stuck to the wrappers and the flavours were dull tasting and uninspired .  i was also surprised at the lack of creativity in terms of christmas flavours or designed . right before christmas you would expect some special flavours ... maybe a candy cane , or gingerbread cupcake . it would be so easy to switch out one flavour and try to get people to consider your product for a christmas party dessert .  having a little kiosk in a mall is a smart idea . sadly , this business is not one i think i will bother with again !
DOC126 i had a craving for mexican and came here ( ie . yelp ) to figure out what we could do , because there is a very real lack of good mexican food in toronto . this place had some good reviews and was n't too far away from us , so off we went .  parking in leaside can be pretty brutal , but we finally found a space and luckily , street parking is free .  the restaurant is tacky , stereotypical , but cozy and we were quickly greeted and seated .  the menu has basic mexican fare , burritos , fajitas , tacos , with your choice of meat . nothing too outside of the box , but that 's not necessarily a bad thing .  we ordered the guacamole to start and i ordered a chicken enchilada and my husband ordered the chimichanga .  the guacamole is very delicious and creamy , but we had to ask for more nachos and even then it felt like not enough . we were really loading up the chips with the guacamole !  the food came out and the was served with rice , a salad ( sort of italian dressing with feta and tomatoes ) and refried beans . the salad was pretty generic and the rice was bland , but the actual main courses were great and the refried beans helped with the spice ( i 'm a wimp ) .  the appetizer and our main courses came to $ 30 and we were very full .  service was good and food was good and it was n't too expensive . it was n't perfect , but we 'll totally be back !
DOC127 came here with my mother , husband and baby for brunch\/lunch . we were all quite happy with our choice . i think i was the `` winner '' by ordering the french toast . it was practically half a loaf of bread , covered with fruit and with delicious cinnamon butter . my husband ordered the stoney 's breakfast , which is your basic eggs , toast , bacon , etc , meal . my mother ordered the omelet . huge portions , but at around $ 11- $ 13 per breakfast meal , it was on the steep end of brunches and other than mine , i 'm not sure the price is warranted , especially since it 's a order at the counter , then find a seat with your number and wait for your meal type place . people were friendly and service was good ( for what it was ) . i would give it a try if i was in the area again .

DOC131 i am surprised at the people complaining about the service , because we found the service to be fine . especially given how busy and cramped it was . there were no tables , but they got us seats at the bar . the music was maybe a little loud , but i enjoyed the 90s throwback that was happening . the place looks like a dive , it 's a total hole in the wall , with no signs to speak of , but i liked the weird atmosphere of weird , old `` ghetto blasters '' on the walls and pics of arnold in terminator . it 's random , just go with it ... but the food ... .oh the food ! we were told that the squash poutine was a must have , so i ordered that and the bulgogi cheese steak , while my friend ordered the poutine and the mackerel . the mackerel was served first . it arrived raw , on a platter and a torch was taken to it to sear the outside and that was it . my friend allowed me a bite and it was so fresh tasting , with a delicious marinade . next came by bulgogi sandwich . fresh , delicious bread and amazing bulgogi . was very pleased . finally the `` poutines '' arrived . i should say that it was not what we were expecting . i assumed it would be squash on top of fries . but in fact the squash was the fries . they were lightly fried and covered in a variety of sauce `` gravies '' and scallions and some other stuff that i could neither make out , nor even see clearly ( dim lighting ) . it does n't matter okay ... .this stuff was heaven ! both my friend and i took a bite and looked at each other ... and proclaimed our new favourite food . other people in our party got the wings , which looked amazing and they said they were and the loosey , which was also proclaimed as delicious . so basically there were no wrong moves . the drink menu was very adventurous ... more so than we were , because we did n't take the plunge , although it was fun sitting at the bar and watching the bartender creating them . and splitting the bill for my friend with two others ( her birthday ) , my two `` tapas '' and a generic alcoholic beverage came to just under $ 30 . the prices are extremely reasonable ... and honestly once you try this stuff ... i mean , i do n't want to give them any ideas , but i would have paid more for that fine , fine food . i will be back . need me some more of that poutine !
DOC132 our friends got the groupon for four people and took us along . i 'm very pleased we went ! having never had ethiopian food before , we were curious , but wary . the deal really helped us dive in . it included two appetizers , four main courses and two desserts . we started with two appetizers , one i was n't a huge fan of ( a `` salad '' with a strong vinegar taste and jalapenos , which i found too strong , although other people in my group really liked it ) . the other appetizer was similar to an indian samosa ( similar name too , but i ca n't remember exactly what it was called ) . they were stuff with lentils and had a flaky shell . they were delicious . but , their appetizers were only made for three people , so there were only three of them ! seems silly when you offer a four person deal . we each ordered a different main course and they brought them on one large platter , so we could all share . we ordered two vegetarian options , one of lentils and one of chickpeas and one of chicken and one of beef . basically , the meals are more sauces than anything and they are served with injera , which are sort of bland , cold , bread-like stuff , which comes rolled up . they 're nothing special , but they 're only used as a sort of utensil , because you use it to scoop up the food . the food was delicious ! i especially liked the chickpea dish . every one of us ended up liking a different dish the best ! worked out well . i personally found the beef dish very tough though . once we were stuff with the food , we ordered two desserts . we especially liked the cheesecake ( which is obviously not ethiopian ) . we asked if they had any ethiopian coffees and they said yes . they showed us the beans , as they were being roasted . then they came back out with a sort of stone earthenware kettle and some small cups . the coffee was so rich , it was almost like chocolate . they also served it with a large basket of popcorn , which was just perfectly prepared . it was such a nice after dinner snack ! i would totally come here just to order the coffee ! it would have been a very expensive dinner without the groupon , so i 'm not sure i would make this a regularly destination , but as i said , the coffee was fantastic and it 's a fun thing to try , especially with friends . make sure they 're good ones , that you do n't mind getting messy in front of !
DOC133 a little on the pricey end for baked goods , but the baked goods are good . also their coffee products are great . the set up is annoying ( order your desserts on one side and coffee and food on another side ) , but the service is good and overall they do a good job .
DOC134 my sister told me that origin was well known for their delicious brunches , so we made a trip there to see if this was the case . origin is pretty new in our area and is very large , but nicely decorated . my only comment would be the washrooms , which feature communal sinks , the kind you find in elementary schools , where you step on the thing at the bottom and water comes out all around . besides not being very effective to quickly wash hands , it 's also wasteful if you 're the only one there . strange concept . throw back , but not necessarily one wants to remember during their brunch . now onto the important part ... the food and service . service started out alright and then immediately got very slow . it took some time to get our drink orders and then took a long time to get our actual orders . i ordered their french toast , my sister ordered tostada and my husband skipped brunch and ordered a meal they offered of a burger , fries covered in some chorizo and sauce and a float . i also ordered a side of bacon ... and was told that they were out of bacon ... which meant any orders that would have come with bacon were out entirely , or would be served without bacon . i 'm sorry but a brunch restaurant without bacon ? even the waitress admitted it was ridiculous . we also shared a plate of buscuits with their preserves . these were delicious . apparently my meal was the one that took the longest . the others got their food and we still waited for five minutes before mine came out . who knew it would take so long to put a couple of pieces of bread on a plate and cover them with blueberry preserves ? my sister said her tostada was quite good . my french toast was nothing special . the toast was `` fancy '' , rounded pieces , on top of each other with whipped cream and blueberries in between . the `` maple '' which was supposed to be on the plate ( maple syrup i 'm guessing ) was barely present . tasted like something i could have created with some ease . my husband 's dish was the best by far . his burger was juicy and this fries were great . the float was a little silly ... this big , meaty burger and fries covered in more meat ... paired with a cream soda float in pink and white layers . ( not insulting , we just got a laugh ) . nothing was cheap and then we had to wait a long time again to get our bill and pay . this was all strange because the restaurant was not particularly busy . because the brunch itself did n't blow me away , food shortages and service , i 'm not sure if i would bother with brunch again . oliver and bonicini in the actual mall has a much better brunch . i might try this again for lunch or dinner though .
DOC135 the saga has finished ... .because i needed to end this bs and move on .  so first off , the store owner responded to my complaints ... by blaming me . apparently it is my fault they sent the wrong thing , because i sent an email and then followed it up with a phone call ... which confused them and made them think there were two orders or something . which makes zero sense , because two orders were not sent . and the person i was speaking with on the phone responded to the emails i sent with codes to try out ... .so i have a hard time believing that they were confused by what was going on and thought that the phone order and email order were different .  they also told me they blocked me on instagram because i was body shaming their models . i want to be very clear on this . i never once body shamed , or made any comments on instagram about their models . i asked why they were promoting clothing they do n't even have in stock on instagram ... apparently that equates to body shaming to them .  they also informed me that because they had to mail so many orders to me ( 3 ) , they were going to start to charge me for shipping . they seemed to forget that i had also been paying to ship items back to them and that i had specifically chosen times when they had free shipping promos taking place to place orders . it 's not that they were n't charging me for shipping ... it was that i was taking advantage of their own promos . apparently i ca n't use their promos anymore , because they have placed an arbitrary rules on how many times you can make a return now . at least for me .  they did not address the code not working .  i responded and expressed continued frustration at their lack of ownership over their mistakes and how poor their customer service continued to be .  then i did some research and sent another email . instead of returning the dress i would donate it to dress for success . i said this seemed like a better choice than continuing to mail clothing back and forth . my request to them was that they take the would be money they would spend on continuing to mail me clothing and take some ownership for their mistakes and channel it into something good . i asked that they take the remaining $ 9.98 credit i had and put it towards them making a small donation , either monetarily or a piece of clothing , also to the charity . i stated that their continued neglect for customer service and lack of ownership over repeated problems should be owned up to , but if they would n't do it for me , perhaps they would be willing to do so for someone in need . i said that would conclude our business and bring something good out of this ridiculousness .  a few hours later i received an email with a letter of thanks for a donation made to dress for success ... for the amount of $ 10 via the store ... .so my remainder amount i had paid for and big sis closet 's contribution of ... .two cents . their generosity is astounding . now , i do n't know that they have n't made their own donation and just not told me of course ... i 'll let you guys decide whether you want to give them the benefit of the doubt in that regard . but given that they have taken zero responsibility for the continued poor management and customer service , well ... i think you can guess what my thoughts are on the subject . no further correspondence was sent from the actual store .  but at any rate , i am donating the new dress to dress for success ( along with my $ 9.98 ) and i am officially done with this store for good . and i sincerely hope that people read this review and think twice about shopping here . the clothes are not good quality , but more than that ... i have never experienced such insanely bad management and customer service in my life . zero regard for their customers , zero regard for their own mistakes , zero regard for taking ownership of ... anything ! just excuse after excuse and then turning the blame around on their customers . these people do not deserve your business and quite frankly ... ladies you deserve better . better clothing ( i have now purchased 6 items and been dissatisfied with the quality of all of them ... loose threads , flimsy , cheap fabric , wrong stitching for the fabric , no lining , incorrect fit for size , etc . ) and a greater degree of respect as a consumer .
DOC136 went here with my sister and her boyfriend for some drinks . we were hungry and ordered a few appetizers to share . drinks were fine ( my mix drink was on the very small side ) , but the food was really good . the perogies and `` chips '' and dip were excellent . the service was good and the atmosphere was nice , for such a small place . bathrooms were also nice , clean , etc . only problem is that some of the tables are so small , it 's really hard to use them . we were at a very small one and even though we fit around it alright , a guy walking by knocked a beer over with his coat and it dumped all down me . i mean all over me . it 's not the bar 's fault the guy knocked the glass , but if the table was a bit bigger we would have had more room to put the glass further in , so it would n't have gotten knocked in the first place . the fact is , if you 're going to serve food people need a place to put it . a few slightly bigger tables would go a long way .

'' right ? nope , she told me she could n't do my hair because i had lice ! of course i freaked out . another hair dresser came over to see if i was alright and i was mortified . she asked if i had experienced any itching . i said no . this hairdresser turned back to the original hairdresser and asked if maybe it was n't too bad yet , but original hairdresser said it was really , really bad . i freaked out and left ( obviously without having anything done ) and went to a shoppers and bought lice shampoo . i went home and had my husband look at my hair . he looked and looked and could find nothing . i still did n't want to take chances , so we tore the house apart and washed and bagged everything and i went to a walk-in clinic . the doctor looked at my head and also said there was nothing there ! since i was paranoid , i still used the shampoo and anytime my head itched in the slightest i went to examine it . but even with my husband and mother looking at my head , we never found a single thing . we did n't even see dandruff ! ! i went to a hairdresser a week later and they told me my hair was beautiful ... but dry at the ends ... yeah , because of the chemical-filled lice shampoo ! thanks a lot you crazy woman ! so ultimately , i never had lice . i do n't know if this woman just decided she did n't feel like doing my hair , or if she was delusional , but i sure wo n't be going back there ever again . no one else should either , unless you want to risk being embarrassed and inconvenienced .
DOC125 i love cupcakes . seriously ... .love affair ! so i 'm always on the lookout for new cupcake places . i was in scarborough town centre and came upon this kiosk . it 's not a storefront , but a rather ingenious booth , with colourful signs and a glass showcase full of cupcakes .  there is a long list of flavours and i suspect ( as with many places ) they make different cupcakes for different days .  i ordered 6 , which was $ 18 ... i know , it 's steep , that 's pretty standard . cupcake places seem to range from around the $ 2.25 mark to around $ 4\/cupcake . so these guys fall somewhere inbetween . but not cheap , so i expect excellence , needless to say .  now , here 's the strange thing . on their website each cupcake is listed as $ 2.90 ... .was this the case at the store ? ? i sure hope not . why would you have to pay more for buying more ? maybe it 's an ordering online thing ? anyway , my guess is that you 're paying $ 3\/cupcake at the store , or $ 18 for 6 . no real incentive to buy 6 . but i did , so moving on ... .  of course i chose a range of flavours : oreo cookie . chocolate with vanilla icing , salted caramel , lemon and a double chocolate .  over two days we managed to work our way through them ( myself and my husband ) and i nibbled the different flavours . lemon was my favorite , by far , with the salted caramel being a huge disappointment . it was entirely too salty . more salt than caramel . it was n't very good at all .  but that said , none of the cupcakes really blew me away . and in fact , they were very stale the next day , despite being stored in an airtight container , in the fridge . luckily , the cold buttercream frosting was easy to scoop off and once they had been in the oven for a few minutes , they softened up a bit .  the bottoms of the cupcakes stuck to the wrappers and the flavours were dull tasting and uninspired .  i was also surprised at the lack of creativity in terms of christmas flavours or designed . right before christmas you would expect some special flavours ... maybe a candy cane , or gingerbread cupcake . it would be so easy to switch out one flavour and try to get people to consider your product for a christmas party dessert .  having a little kiosk in a mall is a smart idea . sadly , this business is not one i think i will bother with again !
DOC126 i had a craving for mexican and came here ( ie . yelp ) to figure out what we could do , because there is a very real lack of good mexican food in toronto . this place had some good reviews and was n't too far away from us , so off we went .  parking in leaside can be pretty brutal , but we finally found a space and luckily , street parking is free .  the restaurant is tacky , stereotypical , but cozy and we were quickly greeted and seated .  the menu has basic mexican fare , burritos , fajitas , tacos , with your choice of meat . nothing too outside of the box , but that 's not necessarily a bad thing .  we ordered the guacamole to start and i ordered a chicken enchilada and my husband ordered the chimichanga .  the guacamole is very delicious and creamy , but we had to ask for more nachos and even then it felt like not enough . we were really loading up the chips with the guacamole !  the food came out and the was served with rice , a salad ( sort of italian dressing with feta and tomatoes ) and refried beans . the salad was pretty generic and the rice was bland , but the actual main courses were great and the refried beans helped with the spice ( i 'm a wimp ) .  the appetizer and our main courses came to $ 30 and we were very full .  service was good and food was good and it was n't too expensive . it was n't perfect , but we 'll totally be back !
DOC127 came here with my mother , husband and baby for brunch\/lunch . we were all quite happy with our choice . i think i was the `` winner '' by ordering the french toast . it was practically half a loaf of bread , covered with fruit and with delicious cinnamon butter . my husband ordered the stoney 's breakfast , which is your basic eggs , toast , bacon , etc , meal . my mother ordered the omelet . huge portions , but at around $ 11- $ 13 per breakfast meal , it was on the steep end of brunches and other than mine , i 'm not sure the price is warranted , especially since it 's a order at the counter , then find a seat with your number and wait for your meal type place . people were friendly and service was good ( for what it was ) . i would give it a try if i was in the area again .
DOC128 never eaten at this place before , but it 's always crowded and i decided that must mean something . i was running errands and had n't eaten the whole day , so decided to finally give this place a shot . i ordered a chicken sandwich and iced tea .  the iced tea does n't appear to be iced tea . it was a dark reddish colour and tasted like very watered down pomegranate juice . it was inedible . it was super gross . i was thinking that maybe they made a mistake , but i ca n't see on the menu anything else it might be and the girl who took my order , poured the drink and gave it to me said it was iced tea . sooooo ew .  sandwich was alright , but just alright . the `` aroma sauce '' which is a garlic mayo of sorts was good and the roasted red peppers and mozzerella on the sandwich were good . the bread was good , but the chicken was the sort of cheap , crappy chicken you find at subway , where it 's a sort of compressed chicken-like white meat , with fake grill marks on it . it had no taste and really took away from the overall sandwich .  there are soups , salads and of course hot beverages served at this place as well , so i 'm not writing it off just yet , but this was not a good first impression .
DOC129 solid soup place ... has an ever-so-slightly sketchy vibe to it ... you order your soup and the woman disappears into the back ... usually closes the sliding window so you ca n't see back there and then eventually emerges with your soup . also seems to sell a selection of jamaican movies in dvd from a glass case ... sort of random .  generous with the veggies , less so with dumplings , but all the soups have great flavour and are decently sized for the price . i wish they would offer some bread or crackers for the soup ... would be a nice , easy add-on . but this place is what it is and does n't bother with the bells and whistles . really deserves a 3.5 stars . the red bean is my fav by far .
DOC130 i would be more inclined to give this place 3-1\/2 stars , but since that 's not possible , i 'm rounding down .  i went here for sunday lunch with a group for winterlicious . for $ 15 we got a choice of appetizer , entree and dessert .  we arrived first and our table was waiting for us . the restaurant was not busy at that point and our waiter was very attentive with water and the wine menu .  once our party finally arrived we all ordered . i had their chipotle sweet potato & goat cheese dip , which was average . the salads looked much better and got better reviews . same with the soup . the dip was literally a dollap of dip at the side of the plate with some crostinis on the other end and 1 piece of pickled cauliflower and a few slices of onion in the middle . the dip was good , the pickled cauliflower alright . it was nice when all combined on the crostini ( pickled veggies , dip on top of crostini ) .  i had originally wanted to order the double pork slider , but i saw it arrive at someone else 's table and it was literally just the one , single mini pork sandwich , with a few thinly cut fries at the side . it looked good , but it was appetizer size , if that . the chicken sandwich was more reasonably sized , so i ordered that . it was good . i really liked the bread . the macaroni was also more reasonably sized . i sampled it and it was fine . did n't blow me away .  dessert was the highlight of the meal for everyone i think . some people ordered the mousse , which i thought was fine , but the people who ordered it loved , so there you have it . my husband loved his apple terrine , which i tried and was good . i liked the flavour of my creme brule very much , but the top was over toasted and had hardened to the consistency of a thin , hard candy . it was hard to break with my spoon and got stuck in my teeth .  the service was consistently good , so no complaints there . none of us had wine with our lunch ( although some had other drinks ) , so i ca n't comment there .  this is a tapas bar , so i expect sizes to be small . but when sizes are small i expect them to be priced accordingly and\/or to be in sharable portions . they gave the prices of each dish if you were to purchased them individually . these would all be hard to share and would n't really be worth it . they are nice as a winterlicious meal , but i 'm not sure this would be my first choice to go back to .
DOC131 i am surprised at the people complaining about the service , because we found the service to be fine . especially given how busy and cramped it was . there were no tables , but they got us seats at the bar . the music was maybe a little loud , but i enjoyed the 90s throwback that was happening . the place looks like a dive , it 's a total hole in the wall , with no signs to speak of , but i liked the weird atmosphere of weird , old `` ghetto blasters '' on the walls and pics of arnold in terminator . it 's random , just go with it ... but the food ... .oh the food ! we were told that the squash poutine was a must have , so i ordered that and the bulgogi cheese steak , while my friend ordered the poutine and the mackerel . the mackerel was served first . it arrived raw , on a platter and a torch was taken to it to sear the outside and that was it . my friend allowed me a bite and it was so fresh tasting , with a delicious marinade . next came by bulgogi sandwich . fresh , delicious bread and amazing bulgogi . was very pleased . finally the `` poutines '' arrived . i should say that it was not what we were expecting . i assumed it would be squash on top of fries . but in fact the squash was the fries . they were lightly fried and covered in a variety of sauce `` gravies '' and scallions and some other stuff that i could neither make out , nor even see clearly ( dim lighting ) . it does n't matter okay ... .this stuff was heaven ! both my friend and i took a bite and looked at each other ... and proclaimed our new favourite food . other people in our party got the wings , which looked amazing and they said they were and the loosey , which was also proclaimed as delicious . so basically there were no wrong moves . the drink menu was very adventurous ... more so than we were , because we did n't take the plunge , although it was fun sitting at the bar and watching the bartender creating them . and splitting the bill for my friend with two others ( her birthday ) , my two `` tapas '' and a generic alcoholic beverage came to just under $ 30 . the prices are extremely reasonable ... and honestly once you try this stuff ... i mean , i do n't want to give them any ideas , but i would have paid more for that fine , fine food . i will be back . need me some more of that poutine !
DOC132 our friends got the groupon for four people and took us along . i 'm very pleased we went ! having never had ethiopian food before , we were curious , but wary . the deal really helped us dive in . it included two appetizers , four main courses and two desserts . we started with two appetizers , one i was n't a huge fan of ( a `` salad '' with a strong vinegar taste and jalapenos , which i found too strong , although other people in my group really liked it ) . the other appetizer was similar to an indian samosa ( similar name too , but i ca n't remember exactly what it was called ) . they were stuff with lentils and had a flaky shell . they were delicious . but , their appetizers were only made for three people , so there were only three of them ! seems silly when you offer a four person deal . we each ordered a different main course and they brought them on one large platter , so we could all share . we ordered two vegetarian options , one of lentils and one of chickpeas and one of chicken and one of beef . basically , the meals are more sauces than anything and they are served with injera , which are sort of bland , cold , bread-like stuff , which comes rolled up . they 're nothing special , but they 're only used as a sort of utensil , because you use it to scoop up the food . the food was delicious ! i especially liked the chickpea dish . every one of us ended up liking a different dish the best ! worked out well . i personally found the beef dish very tough though . once we were stuff with the food , we ordered two desserts . we especially liked the cheesecake ( which is obviously not ethiopian ) . we asked if they had any ethiopian coffees and they said yes . they showed us the beans , as they were being roasted . then they came back out with a sort of stone earthenware kettle and some small cups . the coffee was so rich , it was almost like chocolate . they also served it with a large basket of popcorn , which was just perfectly prepared . it was such a nice after dinner snack ! i would totally come here just to order the coffee ! it would have been a very expensive dinner without the groupon , so i 'm not sure i would make this a regularly destination , but as i said , the coffee was fantastic and it 's a fun thing to try , especially with friends . make sure they 're good ones , that you do n't mind getting messy in front of !
DOC133 a little on the pricey end for baked goods , but the baked goods are good . also their coffee products are great . the set up is annoying ( order your desserts on one side and coffee and food on another side ) , but the service is good and overall they do a good job .
DOC134 my sister told me that origin was well known for their delicious brunches , so we made a trip there to see if this was the case . origin is pretty new in our area and is very large , but nicely decorated . my only comment would be the washrooms , which feature communal sinks , the kind you find in elementary schools , where you step on the thing at the bottom and water comes out all around . besides not being very effective to quickly wash hands , it 's also wasteful if you 're the only one there . strange concept . throw back , but not necessarily one wants to remember during their brunch . now onto the important part ... the food and service . service started out alright and then immediately got very slow . it took some time to get our drink orders and then took a long time to get our actual orders . i ordered their french toast , my sister ordered tostada and my husband skipped brunch and ordered a meal they offered of a burger , fries covered in some chorizo and sauce and a float . i also ordered a side of bacon ... and was told that they were out of bacon ... which meant any orders that would have come with bacon were out entirely , or would be served without bacon . i 'm sorry but a brunch restaurant without bacon ? even the waitress admitted it was ridiculous . we also shared a plate of buscuits with their preserves . these were delicious . apparently my meal was the one that took the longest . the others got their food and we still waited for five minutes before mine came out . who knew it would take so long to put a couple of pieces of bread on a plate and cover them with blueberry preserves ? my sister said her tostada was quite good . my french toast was nothing special . the toast was `` fancy '' , rounded pieces , on top of each other with whipped cream and blueberries in between . the `` maple '' which was supposed to be on the plate ( maple syrup i 'm guessing ) was barely present . tasted like something i could have created with some ease . my husband 's dish was the best by far . his burger was juicy and this fries were great . the float was a little silly ... this big , meaty burger and fries covered in more meat ... paired with a cream soda float in pink and white layers . ( not insulting , we just got a laugh ) . nothing was cheap and then we had to wait a long time again to get our bill and pay . this was all strange because the restaurant was not particularly busy . because the brunch itself did n't blow me away , food shortages and service , i 'm not sure if i would bother with brunch again . oliver and bonicini in the actual mall has a much better brunch . i might try this again for lunch or dinner though .
DOC135 the saga has finished ... .because i needed to end this bs and move on .  so first off , the store owner responded to my complaints ... by blaming me . apparently it is my fault they sent the wrong thing , because i sent an email and then followed it up with a phone call ... which confused them and made them think there were two orders or something . which makes zero sense , because two orders were not sent . and the person i was speaking with on the phone responded to the emails i sent with codes to try out ... .so i have a hard time believing that they were confused by what was going on and thought that the phone order and email order were different .  they also told me they blocked me on instagram because i was body shaming their models . i want to be very clear on this . i never once body shamed , or made any comments on instagram about their models . i asked why they were promoting clothing they do n't even have in stock on instagram ... apparently that equates to body shaming to them .  they also informed me that because they had to mail so many orders to me ( 3 ) , they were going to start to charge me for shipping . they seemed to forget that i had also been paying to ship items back to them and that i had specifically chosen times when they had free shipping promos taking place to place orders . it 's not that they were n't charging me for shipping ... it was that i was taking advantage of their own promos . apparently i ca n't use their promos anymore , because they have placed an arbitrary rules on how many times you can make a return now . at least for me .  they did not address the code not working .  i responded and expressed continued frustration at their lack of ownership over their mistakes and how poor their customer service continued to be .  then i did some research and sent another email . instead of returning the dress i would donate it to dress for success . i said this seemed like a better choice than continuing to mail clothing back and forth . my request to them was that they take the would be money they would spend on continuing to mail me clothing and take some ownership for their mistakes and channel it into something good . i asked that they take the remaining $ 9.98 credit i had and put it towards them making a small donation , either monetarily or a piece of clothing , also to the charity . i stated that their continued neglect for customer service and lack of ownership over repeated problems should be owned up to , but if they would n't do it for me , perhaps they would be willing to do so for someone in need . i said that would conclude our business and bring something good out of this ridiculousness .  a few hours later i received an email with a letter of thanks for a donation made to dress for success ... for the amount of $ 10 via the store ... .so my remainder amount i had paid for and big sis closet 's contribution of ... .two cents . their generosity is astounding . now , i do n't know that they have n't made their own donation and just not told me of course ... i 'll let you guys decide whether you want to give them the benefit of the doubt in that regard . but given that they have taken zero responsibility for the continued poor management and customer service , well ... i think you can guess what my thoughts are on the subject . no further correspondence was sent from the actual store .  but at any rate , i am donating the new dress to dress for success ( along with my $ 9.98 ) and i am officially done with this store for good . and i sincerely hope that people read this review and think twice about shopping here . the clothes are not good quality , but more than that ... i have never experienced such insanely bad management and customer service in my life . zero regard for their customers , zero regard for their own mistakes , zero regard for taking ownership of ... anything ! just excuse after excuse and then turning the blame around on their customers . these people do not deserve your business and quite frankly ... ladies you deserve better . better clothing ( i have now purchased 6 items and been dissatisfied with the quality of all of them ... loose threads , flimsy , cheap fabric , wrong stitching for the fabric , no lining , incorrect fit for size , etc . ) and a greater degree of respect as a consumer .
DOC136 went here with my sister and her boyfriend for some drinks . we were hungry and ordered a few appetizers to share . drinks were fine ( my mix drink was on the very small side ) , but the food was really good . the perogies and `` chips '' and dip were excellent . the service was good and the atmosphere was nice , for such a small place . bathrooms were also nice , clean , etc . only problem is that some of the tables are so small , it 's really hard to use them . we were at a very small one and even though we fit around it alright , a guy walking by knocked a beer over with his coat and it dumped all down me . i mean all over me . it 's not the bar 's fault the guy knocked the glass , but if the table was a bit bigger we would have had more room to put the glass further in , so it would n't have gotten knocked in the first place . the fact is , if you 're going to serve food people need a place to put it . a few slightly bigger tables would go a long way .
DOC121 after being scared away from rock & rita 's , we ended up at this place , which was , if nothing else , quieter .  i 'll start by saying that the hostess and our server were both lovely and they 're really what earned the single star , because they were sweet , but the food was just horrible .  i ordered a simple grilled cheese sandwich . i asked the server if it was processed cheese , or `` real '' cheese in the sandwich and he had no idea what i was talking about . i tried to clarify by saying , `` is it like kraft single slices , or deli cheese ? '' he said it was `` good '' . this really should have been a sign and i could probably fault the waiter for this , since you should know what you 're serving , but he was so sweet , i could n't be mad !  my husband ordered a hot dog of sorts .  i asked if there was a way to substitute fries for a salad . there was not , but the server hooked me up and brought me a salad anyway ( no charge ) . i asked for sweet potato fries with the sandwich .  of course , my sandwich was made with plasticy , processed cheese , that was melted to the point of cheeze-wiz and was inedible . i took one bite of the sandwich and could n't do another . i got regular fries , instead of sweet potato ( did n't bother complaining , because i got the free salad , so whatever ... like i said , nice server ! ) my husband 's food was fine , although nothing special . they were good with the refills of our drinks .  anyway , as nice as the servers were , it was n't good . i would avoid eating here if i could .
DOC122 we got recommendations for this place from my parents and so , for our anniversary , we booked here . we were told though that it was first come , first served , in terms of having the ideal seats by the windows that overlook the fountains of the bellagio and the strip . we went for lunch though , so it was n't too busy . we were seated by the window and were promptly served some sort of puffed rolls , with cheese and herbs infused . they were delicious !  we ordered the onion soup to start and i ordered parmesan chicken and my husband ordered a lamb burger . our food came and was delicious . the soup was probably my favorite part . we were feeling very full by the end and so declined dessert , but were still given some jellies and chocolate truffle and then were served a small chocolate mousse , on a decorated plate that said happy anniversary , which was a total surprise ( they had asked when i booked if it was a special occasion , but had said nothing while we were there ) . overall the service was great , the food delicious and the view wonderful . it was a great experience !
DOC123 i went here for the first time yesterday night to celebrate something with my family . several members of my family have been to this place before for summerlicious and really enjoyed it .  a nice atmosphere and excellent service , everyone ordered a variety of different dishes , many of which i tasted . i myself had a chicken salad and thought it was very good . my sister 's pasta dish was amazing though ! our waiter never rushed us out and was quick to refill water and bread and clear dishes , etc . that with an arm brace on !  prices are a little high , which is why i did n't give this place five stars ... i know those amazing places exist out there with great food and great prices , but this was a nice evening out .

DOC129 solid soup place ... has an ever-so-slightly sketchy vibe to it ... you order your soup and the woman disappears into the back ... usually closes the sliding window so you ca n't see back there and then eventually emerges with your soup . also seems to sell a selection of jamaican movies in dvd from a glass case ... sort of random .  generous with the veggies , less so with dumplings , but all the soups have great flavour and are decently sized for the price . i wish they would offer some bread or crackers for the soup ... would be a nice , easy add-on . but this place is what it is and does n't bother with the bells and whistles . really deserves a 3.5 stars . the red bean is my fav by far .
DOC130 i would be more inclined to give this place 3-1\/2 stars , but since that 's not possible , i 'm rounding down .  i went here for sunday lunch with a group for winterlicious . for $ 15 we got a choice of appetizer , entree and dessert .  we arrived first and our table was waiting for us . the restaurant was not busy at that point and our waiter was very attentive with water and the wine menu .  once our party finally arrived we all ordered . i had their chipotle sweet potato & goat cheese dip , which was average . the salads looked much better and got better reviews . same with the soup . the dip was literally a dollap of dip at the side of the plate with some crostinis on the other end and 1 piece of pickled cauliflower and a few slices of onion in the middle . the dip was good , the pickled cauliflower alright . it was nice when all combined on the crostini ( pickled veggies , dip on top of crostini ) .  i had originally wanted to order the double pork slider , but i saw it arrive at someone else 's table and it was literally just the one , single mini pork sandwich , with a few thinly cut fries at the side . it looked good , but it was appetizer size , if that . the chicken sandwich was more reasonably sized , so i ordered that . it was good . i really liked the bread . the macaroni was also more reasonably sized . i sampled it and it was fine . did n't blow me away .  dessert was the highlight of the meal for everyone i think . some people ordered the mousse , which i thought was fine , but the people who ordered it loved , so there you have it . my husband loved his apple terrine , which i tried and was good . i liked the flavour of my creme brule very much , but the top was over toasted and had hardened to the consistency of a thin , hard candy . it was hard to break with my spoon and got stuck in my teeth .  the service was consistently good , so no complaints there . none of us had wine with our lunch ( although some had other drinks ) , so i ca n't comment there .  this is a tapas bar , so i expect sizes to be small . but when sizes are small i expect them to be priced accordingly and\/or to be in sharable portions . they gave the prices of each dish if you were to purchased them individually . these would all be hard to share and would n't really be worth it . they are nice as a winterlicious meal , but i 'm not sure this would be my first choice to go back to .
DOC121 after being scared away from rock & rita 's , we ended up at this place , which was , if nothing else , quieter .  i 'll start by saying that the hostess and our server were both lovely and they 're really what earned the single star , because they were sweet , but the food was just horrible .  i ordered a simple grilled cheese sandwich . i asked the server if it was processed cheese , or `` real '' cheese in the sandwich and he had no idea what i was talking about . i tried to clarify by saying , `` is it like kraft single slices , or deli cheese ? '' he said it was `` good '' . this really should have been a sign and i could probably fault the waiter for this , since you should know what you 're serving , but he was so sweet , i could n't be mad !  my husband ordered a hot dog of sorts .  i asked if there was a way to substitute fries for a salad . there was not , but the server hooked me up and brought me a salad anyway ( no charge ) . i asked for sweet potato fries with the sandwich .  of course , my sandwich was made with plasticy , processed cheese , that was melted to the point of cheeze-wiz and was inedible . i took one bite of the sandwich and could n't do another . i got regular fries , instead of sweet potato ( did n't bother complaining , because i got the free salad , so whatever ... like i said , nice server ! ) my husband 's food was fine , although nothing special . they were good with the refills of our drinks .  anyway , as nice as the servers were , it was n't good . i would avoid eating here if i could .
DOC122 we got recommendations for this place from my parents and so , for our anniversary , we booked here . we were told though that it was first come , first served , in terms of having the ideal seats by the windows that overlook the fountains of the bellagio and the strip . we went for lunch though , so it was n't too busy . we were seated by the window and were promptly served some sort of puffed rolls , with cheese and herbs infused . they were delicious !  we ordered the onion soup to start and i ordered parmesan chicken and my husband ordered a lamb burger . our food came and was delicious . the soup was probably my favorite part . we were feeling very full by the end and so declined dessert , but were still given some jellies and chocolate truffle and then were served a small chocolate mousse , on a decorated plate that said happy anniversary , which was a total surprise ( they had asked when i booked if it was a special occasion , but had said nothing while we were there ) . overall the service was great , the food delicious and the view wonderful . it was a great experience !
DOC123 i went here for the first time yesterday night to celebrate something with my family . several members of my family have been to this place before for summerlicious and really enjoyed it .  a nice atmosphere and excellent service , everyone ordered a variety of different dishes , many of which i tasted . i myself had a chicken salad and thought it was very good . my sister 's pasta dish was amazing though ! our waiter never rushed us out and was quick to refill water and bread and clear dishes , etc . that with an arm brace on !  prices are a little high , which is why i did n't give this place five stars ... i know those amazing places exist out there with great food and great prices , but this was a nice evening out .
DOC124 worst experience ever ! i had been there before to get my nails done and the first time was quite good , but the second time was a hot mess . it looked like a five year old did my nails for me . i went home and took the polish off . but this is the kicker : i could n't get an appointment for highlights at my regular salon and this was close by , so i decided to give it a try ( obviously the nail girl would n't be doing my hair ) . i went in and sat down the a woman with an eastern european accent came to talk with me . i showed her a picture of what i wanted and she showed me various hair dye samples ... .none of which looked like my picture , but i always assume the hair dressers know what 's best . now , you 're all thinking , `` ..and she did a poor job and you hated the colour ... '' right ? nope , she told me she could n't do my hair because i had lice ! of course i freaked out . another hair dresser came over to see if i was alright and i was mortified . she asked if i had experienced any itching . i said no . this hairdresser turned back to the original hairdresser and asked if maybe it was n't too bad yet , but original hairdresser said it was really , really bad . i freaked out and left ( obviously without having anything done ) and went to a shoppers and bought lice shampoo . i went home and had my husband look at my hair . he looked and looked and could find nothing . i still did n't want to take chances , so we tore the house apart and washed and bagged everything and i went to a walk-in clinic . the doctor looked at my head and also said there was nothing there ! since i was paranoid , i still used the shampoo and anytime my head itched in the slightest i went to examine it . but even with my husband and mother looking at my head , we never found a single thing . we did n't even see dandruff ! ! i went to a hairdresser a week later and they told me my hair was beautiful ... but dry at the ends ... yeah , because of the chemical-filled lice shampoo ! thanks a lot you crazy woman ! so ultimately , i never had lice . i do n't know if this woman just decided she did n't feel like doing my hair , or if she was delusional , but i sure wo n't be going back there ever again . no one else should either , unless you want to risk being embarrassed and inconvenienced .
DOC125 i love cupcakes . seriously ... .love affair ! so i 'm always on the lookout for new cupcake places . i was in scarborough town centre and came upon this kiosk . it 's not a storefront , but a rather ingenious booth , with colourful signs and a glass showcase full of cupcakes .  there is a long list of flavours and i suspect ( as with many places ) they make different cupcakes for different days .  i ordered 6 , which was $ 18 ... i know , it 's steep , that 's pretty standard . cupcake places seem to range from around the $ 2.25 mark to around $ 4\/cupcake . so these guys fall somewhere inbetween . but not cheap , so i expect excellence , needless to say .  now , here 's the strange thing . on their website each cupcake is listed as $ 2.90 ... .was this the case at the store ? ? i sure hope not . why would you have to pay more for buying more ? maybe it 's an ordering online thing ? anyway , my guess is that you 're paying $ 3\/cupcake at the store , or $ 18 for 6 . no real incentive to buy 6 . but i did , so moving on ... .  of course i chose a range of flavours : oreo cookie . chocolate with vanilla icing , salted caramel , lemon and a double chocolate .  over two days we managed to work our way through them ( myself and my husband ) and i nibbled the different flavours . lemon was my favorite , by far , with the salted caramel being a huge disappointment . it was entirely too salty . more salt than caramel . it was n't very good at all .  but that said , none of the cupcakes really blew me away . and in fact , they were very stale the next day , despite being stored in an airtight container , in the fridge . luckily , the cold buttercream frosting was easy to scoop off and once they had been in the oven for a few minutes , they softened up a bit .  the bottoms of the cupcakes stuck to the wrappers and the flavours were dull tasting and uninspired .  i was also surprised at the lack of creativity in terms of christmas flavours or designed . right before christmas you would expect some special flavours ... maybe a candy cane , or gingerbread cupcake . it would be so easy to switch out one flavour and try to get people to consider your product for a christmas party dessert .  having a little kiosk in a mall is a smart idea . sadly , this business is not one i think i will bother with again !
DOC126 i had a craving for mexican and came here ( ie . yelp ) to figure out what we could do , because there is a very real lack of good mexican food in toronto . this place had some good reviews and was n't too far away from us , so off we went .  parking in leaside can be pretty brutal , but we finally found a space and luckily , street parking is free .  the restaurant is tacky , stereotypical , but cozy and we were quickly greeted and seated .  the menu has basic mexican fare , burritos , fajitas , tacos , with your choice of meat . nothing too outside of the box , but that 's not necessarily a bad thing .  we ordered the guacamole to start and i ordered a chicken enchilada and my husband ordered the chimichanga .  the guacamole is very delicious and creamy , but we had to ask for more nachos and even then it felt like not enough . we were really loading up the chips with the guacamole !  the food came out and the was served with rice , a salad ( sort of italian dressing with feta and tomatoes ) and refried beans . the salad was pretty generic and the rice was bland , but the actual main courses were great and the refried beans helped with the spice ( i 'm a wimp ) .  the appetizer and our main courses came to $ 30 and we were very full .  service was good and food was good and it was n't too expensive . it was n't perfect , but we 'll totally be back !

DOC131 i am surprised at the people complaining about the service , because we found the service to be fine . especially given how busy and cramped it was . there were no tables , but they got us seats at the bar . the music was maybe a little loud , but i enjoyed the 90s throwback that was happening . the place looks like a dive , it 's a total hole in the wall , with no signs to speak of , but i liked the weird atmosphere of weird , old `` ghetto blasters '' on the walls and pics of arnold in terminator . it 's random , just go with it ... but the food ... .oh the food ! we were told that the squash poutine was a must have , so i ordered that and the bulgogi cheese steak , while my friend ordered the poutine and the mackerel . the mackerel was served first . it arrived raw , on a platter and a torch was taken to it to sear the outside and that was it . my friend allowed me a bite and it was so fresh tasting , with a delicious marinade . next came by bulgogi sandwich . fresh , delicious bread and amazing bulgogi . was very pleased . finally the `` poutines '' arrived . i should say that it was not what we were expecting . i assumed it would be squash on top of fries . but in fact the squash was the fries . they were lightly fried and covered in a variety of sauce `` gravies '' and scallions and some other stuff that i could neither make out , nor even see clearly ( dim lighting ) . it does n't matter okay ... .this stuff was heaven ! both my friend and i took a bite and looked at each other ... and proclaimed our new favourite food . other people in our party got the wings , which looked amazing and they said they were and the loosey , which was also proclaimed as delicious . so basically there were no wrong moves . the drink menu was very adventurous ... more so than we were , because we did n't take the plunge , although it was fun sitting at the bar and watching the bartender creating them . and splitting the bill for my friend with two others ( her birthday ) , my two `` tapas '' and a generic alcoholic beverage came to just under $ 30 . the prices are extremely reasonable ... and honestly once you try this stuff ... i mean , i do n't want to give them any ideas , but i would have paid more for that fine , fine food . i will be back . need me some more of that poutine !
DOC132 our friends got the groupon for four people and took us along . i 'm very pleased we went ! having never had ethiopian food before , we were curious , but wary . the deal really helped us dive in . it included two appetizers , four main courses and two desserts . we started with two appetizers , one i was n't a huge fan of ( a `` salad '' with a strong vinegar taste and jalapenos , which i found too strong , although other people in my group really liked it ) . the other appetizer was similar to an indian samosa ( similar name too , but i ca n't remember exactly what it was called ) . they were stuff with lentils and had a flaky shell . they were delicious . but , their appetizers were only made for three people , so there were only three of them ! seems silly when you offer a four person deal . we each ordered a different main course and they brought them on one large platter , so we could all share . we ordered two vegetarian options , one of lentils and one of chickpeas and one of chicken and one of beef . basically , the meals are more sauces than anything and they are served with injera , which are sort of bland , cold , bread-like stuff , which comes rolled up . they 're nothing special , but they 're only used as a sort of utensil , because you use it to scoop up the food . the food was delicious ! i especially liked the chickpea dish . every one of us ended up liking a different dish the best ! worked out well . i personally found the beef dish very tough though . once we were stuff with the food , we ordered two desserts . we especially liked the cheesecake ( which is obviously not ethiopian ) . we asked if they had any ethiopian coffees and they said yes . they showed us the beans , as they were being roasted . then they came back out with a sort of stone earthenware kettle and some small cups . the coffee was so rich , it was almost like chocolate . they also served it with a large basket of popcorn , which was just perfectly prepared . it was such a nice after dinner snack ! i would totally come here just to order the coffee ! it would have been a very expensive dinner without the groupon , so i 'm not sure i would make this a regularly destination , but as i said , the coffee was fantastic and it 's a fun thing to try , especially with friends . make sure they 're good ones , that you do n't mind getting messy in front of !
DOC133 a little on the pricey end for baked goods , but the baked goods are good . also their coffee products are great . the set up is annoying ( order your desserts on one side and coffee and food on another side ) , but the service is good and overall they do a good job .
DOC134 my sister told me that origin was well known for their delicious brunches , so we made a trip there to see if this was the case . origin is pretty new in our area and is very large , but nicely decorated . my only comment would be the washrooms , which feature communal sinks , the kind you find in elementary schools , where you step on the thing at the bottom and water comes out all around . besides not being very effective to quickly wash hands , it 's also wasteful if you 're the only one there . strange concept . throw back , but not necessarily one wants to remember during their brunch . now onto the important part ... the food and service . service started out alright and then immediately got very slow . it took some time to get our drink orders and then took a long time to get our actual orders . i ordered their french toast , my sister ordered tostada and my husband skipped brunch and ordered a meal they offered of a burger , fries covered in some chorizo and sauce and a float . i also ordered a side of bacon ... and was told that they were out of bacon ... which meant any orders that would have come with bacon were out entirely , or would be served without bacon . i 'm sorry but a brunch restaurant without bacon ? even the waitress admitted it was ridiculous . we also shared a plate of buscuits with their preserves . these were delicious . apparently my meal was the one that took the longest . the others got their food and we still waited for five minutes before mine came out . who knew it would take so long to put a couple of pieces of bread on a plate and cover them with blueberry preserves ? my sister said her tostada was quite good . my french toast was nothing special . the toast was `` fancy '' , rounded pieces , on top of each other with whipped cream and blueberries in between . the `` maple '' which was supposed to be on the plate ( maple syrup i 'm guessing ) was barely present . tasted like something i could have created with some ease . my husband 's dish was the best by far . his burger was juicy and this fries were great . the float was a little silly ... this big , meaty burger and fries covered in more meat ... paired with a cream soda float in pink and white layers . ( not insulting , we just got a laugh ) . nothing was cheap and then we had to wait a long time again to get our bill and pay . this was all strange because the restaurant was not particularly busy . because the brunch itself did n't blow me away , food shortages and service , i 'm not sure if i would bother with brunch again . oliver and bonicini in the actual mall has a much better brunch . i might try this again for lunch or dinner though .
DOC135 the saga has finished ... .because i needed to end this bs and move on .  so first off , the store owner responded to my complaints ... by blaming me . apparently it is my fault they sent the wrong thing , because i sent an email and then followed it up with a phone call ... which confused them and made them think there were two orders or something . which makes zero sense , because two orders were not sent . and the person i was speaking with on the phone responded to the emails i sent with codes to try out ... .so i have a hard time believing that they were confused by what was going on and thought that the phone order and email order were different .  they also told me they blocked me on instagram because i was body shaming their models . i want to be very clear on this . i never once body shamed , or made any comments on instagram about their models . i asked why they were promoting clothing they do n't even have in stock on instagram ... apparently that equates to body shaming to them .  they also informed me that because they had to mail so many orders to me ( 3 ) , they were going to start to charge me for shipping . they seemed to forget that i had also been paying to ship items back to them and that i had specifically chosen times when they had free shipping promos taking place to place orders . it 's not that they were n't charging me for shipping ... it was that i was taking advantage of their own promos . apparently i ca n't use their promos anymore , because they have placed an arbitrary rules on how many times you can make a return now . at least for me .  they did not address the code not working .  i responded and expressed continued frustration at their lack of ownership over their mistakes and how poor their customer service continued to be .  then i did some research and sent another email . instead of returning the dress i would donate it to dress for success . i said this seemed like a better choice than continuing to mail clothing back and forth . my request to them was that they take the would be money they would spend on continuing to mail me clothing and take some ownership for their mistakes and channel it into something good . i asked that they take the remaining $ 9.98 credit i had and put it towards them making a small donation , either monetarily or a piece of clothing , also to the charity . i stated that their continued neglect for customer service and lack of ownership over repeated problems should be owned up to , but if they would n't do it for me , perhaps they would be willing to do so for someone in need . i said that would conclude our business and bring something good out of this ridiculousness .  a few hours later i received an email with a letter of thanks for a donation made to dress for success ... for the amount of $ 10 via the store ... .so my remainder amount i had paid for and big sis closet 's contribution of ... .two cents . their generosity is astounding . now , i do n't know that they have n't made their own donation and just not told me of course ... i 'll let you guys decide whether you want to give them the benefit of the doubt in that regard . but given that they have taken zero responsibility for the continued poor management and customer service , well ... i think you can guess what my thoughts are on the subject . no further correspondence was sent from the actual store .  but at any rate , i am donating the new dress to dress for success ( along with my $ 9.98 ) and i am officially done with this store for good . and i sincerely hope that people read this review and think twice about shopping here . the clothes are not good quality , but more than that ... i have never experienced such insanely bad management and customer service in my life . zero regard for their customers , zero regard for their own mistakes , zero regard for taking ownership of ... anything ! just excuse after excuse and then turning the blame around on their customers . these people do not deserve your business and quite frankly ... ladies you deserve better . better clothing ( i have now purchased 6 items and been dissatisfied with the quality of all of them ... loose threads , flimsy , cheap fabric , wrong stitching for the fabric , no lining , incorrect fit for size , etc . ) and a greater degree of respect as a consumer .
DOC136 went here with my sister and her boyfriend for some drinks . we were hungry and ordered a few appetizers to share . drinks were fine ( my mix drink was on the very small side ) , but the food was really good . the perogies and `` chips '' and dip were excellent . the service was good and the atmosphere was nice , for such a small place . bathrooms were also nice , clean , etc . only problem is that some of the tables are so small , it 's really hard to use them . we were at a very small one and even though we fit around it alright , a guy walking by knocked a beer over with his coat and it dumped all down me . i mean all over me . it 's not the bar 's fault the guy knocked the glass , but if the table was a bit bigger we would have had more room to put the glass further in , so it would n't have gotten knocked in the first place . the fact is , if you 're going to serve food people need a place to put it . a few slightly bigger tables would go a long way .

DOC124 worst experience ever ! i had been there before to get my nails done and the first time was quite good , but the second time was a hot mess . it looked like a five year old did my nails for me . i went home and took the polish off . but this is the kicker : i could n't get an appointment for highlights at my regular salon and this was close by , so i decided to give it a try ( obviously the nail girl would n't be doing my hair ) . i went in and sat down the a woman with an eastern european accent came to talk with me . i showed her a picture of what i wanted and she showed me various hair dye samples ... .none of which looked like my picture , but i always assume the hair dressers know what 's best . now , you 're all thinking , `` ..and she did a poor job and you hated the colour ... '' right ? nope , she told me she could n't do my hair because i had lice ! of course i freaked out . another hair dresser came over to see if i was alright and i was mortified . she asked if i had experienced any itching . i said no . this hairdresser turned back to the original hairdresser and asked if maybe it was n't too bad yet , but original hairdresser said it was really , really bad . i freaked out and left ( obviously without having anything done ) and went to a shoppers and bought lice shampoo . i went home and had my husband look at my hair . he looked and looked and could find nothing . i still did n't want to take chances , so we tore the house apart and washed and bagged everything and i went to a walk-in clinic . the doctor looked at my head and also said there was nothing there ! since i was paranoid , i still used the shampoo and anytime my head itched in the slightest i went to examine it . but even with my husband and mother looking at my head , we never found a single thing . we did n't even see dandruff ! ! i went to a hairdresser a week later and they told me my hair was beautiful ... but dry at the ends ... yeah , because of the chemical-filled lice shampoo ! thanks a lot you crazy woman ! so ultimately , i never had lice . i do n't know if this woman just decided she did n't feel like doing my hair , or if she was delusional , but i sure wo n't be going back there ever again . no one else should either , unless you want to risk being embarrassed and inconvenienced .
DOC125 i love cupcakes . seriously ... .love affair ! so i 'm always on the lookout for new cupcake places . i was in scarborough town centre and came upon this kiosk . it 's not a storefront , but a rather ingenious booth , with colourful signs and a glass showcase full of cupcakes .  there is a long list of flavours and i suspect ( as with many places ) they make different cupcakes for different days .  i ordered 6 , which was $ 18 ... i know , it 's steep , that 's pretty standard . cupcake places seem to range from around the $ 2.25 mark to around $ 4\/cupcake . so these guys fall somewhere inbetween . but not cheap , so i expect excellence , needless to say .  now , here 's the strange thing . on their website each cupcake is listed as $ 2.90 ... .was this the case at the store ? ? i sure hope not . why would you have to pay more for buying more ? maybe it 's an ordering online thing ? anyway , my guess is that you 're paying $ 3\/cupcake at the store , or $ 18 for 6 . no real incentive to buy 6 . but i did , so moving on ... .  of course i chose a range of flavours : oreo cookie . chocolate with vanilla icing , salted caramel , lemon and a double chocolate .  over two days we managed to work our way through them ( myself and my husband ) and i nibbled the different flavours . lemon was my favorite , by far , with the salted caramel being a huge disappointment . it was entirely too salty . more salt than caramel . it was n't very good at all .  but that said , none of the cupcakes really blew me away . and in fact , they were very stale the next day , despite being stored in an airtight container , in the fridge . luckily , the cold buttercream frosting was easy to scoop off and once they had been in the oven for a few minutes , they softened up a bit .  the bottoms of the cupcakes stuck to the wrappers and the flavours were dull tasting and uninspired .  i was also surprised at the lack of creativity in terms of christmas flavours or designed . right before christmas you would expect some special flavours ... maybe a candy cane , or gingerbread cupcake . it would be so easy to switch out one flavour and try to get people to consider your product for a christmas party dessert .  having a little kiosk in a mall is a smart idea . sadly , this business is not one i think i will bother with again !
DOC126 i had a craving for mexican and came here ( ie . yelp ) to figure out what we could do , because there is a very real lack of good mexican food in toronto . this place had some good reviews and was n't too far away from us , so off we went .  parking in leaside can be pretty brutal , but we finally found a space and luckily , street parking is free .  the restaurant is tacky , stereotypical , but cozy and we were quickly greeted and seated .  the menu has basic mexican fare , burritos , fajitas , tacos , with your choice of meat . nothing too outside of the box , but that 's not necessarily a bad thing .  we ordered the guacamole to start and i ordered a chicken enchilada and my husband ordered the chimichanga .  the guacamole is very delicious and creamy , but we had to ask for more nachos and even then it felt like not enough . we were really loading up the chips with the guacamole !  the food came out and the was served with rice , a salad ( sort of italian dressing with feta and tomatoes ) and refried beans . the salad was pretty generic and the rice was bland , but the actual main courses were great and the refried beans helped with the spice ( i 'm a wimp ) .  the appetizer and our main courses came to $ 30 and we were very full .  service was good and food was good and it was n't too expensive . it was n't perfect , but we 'll totally be back !
DOC127 came here with my mother , husband and baby for brunch\/lunch . we were all quite happy with our choice . i think i was the `` winner '' by ordering the french toast . it was practically half a loaf of bread , covered with fruit and with delicious cinnamon butter . my husband ordered the stoney 's breakfast , which is your basic eggs , toast , bacon , etc , meal . my mother ordered the omelet . huge portions , but at around $ 11- $ 13 per breakfast meal , it was on the steep end of brunches and other than mine , i 'm not sure the price is warranted , especially since it 's a order at the counter , then find a seat with your number and wait for your meal type place . people were friendly and service was good ( for what it was ) . i would give it a try if i was in the area again .
DOC128 never eaten at this place before , but it 's always crowded and i decided that must mean something . i was running errands and had n't eaten the whole day , so decided to finally give this place a shot . i ordered a chicken sandwich and iced tea .  the iced tea does n't appear to be iced tea . it was a dark reddish colour and tasted like very watered down pomegranate juice . it was inedible . it was super gross . i was thinking that maybe they made a mistake , but i ca n't see on the menu anything else it might be and the girl who took my order , poured the drink and gave it to me said it was iced tea . sooooo ew .  sandwich was alright , but just alright . the `` aroma sauce '' which is a garlic mayo of sorts was good and the roasted red peppers and mozzerella on the sandwich were good . the bread was good , but the chicken was the sort of cheap , crappy chicken you find at subway , where it 's a sort of compressed chicken-like white meat , with fake grill marks on it . it had no taste and really took away from the overall sandwich .  there are soups , salads and of course hot beverages served at this place as well , so i 'm not writing it off just yet , but this was not a good first impression .
DOC129 solid soup place ... has an ever-so-slightly sketchy vibe to it ... you order your soup and the woman disappears into the back ... usually closes the sliding window so you ca n't see back there and then eventually emerges with your soup . also seems to sell a selection of jamaican movies in dvd from a glass case ... sort of random .  generous with the veggies , less so with dumplings , but all the soups have great flavour and are decently sized for the price . i wish they would offer some bread or crackers for the soup ... would be a nice , easy add-on . but this place is what it is and does n't bother with the bells and whistles . really deserves a 3.5 stars . the red bean is my fav by far .
DOC130 i would be more inclined to give this place 3-1\/2 stars , but since that 's not possible , i 'm rounding down .  i went here for sunday lunch with a group for winterlicious . for $ 15 we got a choice of appetizer , entree and dessert .  we arrived first and our table was waiting for us . the restaurant was not busy at that point and our waiter was very attentive with water and the wine menu .  once our party finally arrived we all ordered . i had their chipotle sweet potato & goat cheese dip , which was average . the salads looked much better and got better reviews . same with the soup . the dip was literally a dollap of dip at the side of the plate with some crostinis on the other end and 1 piece of pickled cauliflower and a few slices of onion in the middle . the dip was good , the pickled cauliflower alright . it was nice when all combined on the crostini ( pickled veggies , dip on top of crostini ) .  i had originally wanted to order the double pork slider , but i saw it arrive at someone else 's table and it was literally just the one , single mini pork sandwich , with a few thinly cut fries at the side . it looked good , but it was appetizer size , if that . the chicken sandwich was more reasonably sized , so i ordered that . it was good . i really liked the bread . the macaroni was also more reasonably sized . i sampled it and it was fine . did n't blow me away .  dessert was the highlight of the meal for everyone i think . some people ordered the mousse , which i thought was fine , but the people who ordered it loved , so there you have it . my husband loved his apple terrine , which i tried and was good . i liked the flavour of my creme brule very much , but the top was over toasted and had hardened to the consistency of a thin , hard candy . it was hard to break with my spoon and got stuck in my teeth .  the service was consistently good , so no complaints there . none of us had wine with our lunch ( although some had other drinks ) , so i ca n't comment there .  this is a tapas bar , so i expect sizes to be small . but when sizes are small i expect them to be priced accordingly and\/or to be in sharable portions . they gave the prices of each dish if you were to purchased them individually . these would all be hard to share and would n't really be worth it . they are nice as a winterlicious meal , but i 'm not sure this would be my first choice to go back to .
DOC131 i am surprised at the people complaining about the service , because we found the service to be fine . especially given how busy and cramped it was . there were no tables , but they got us seats at the bar . the music was maybe a little loud , but i enjoyed the 90s throwback that was happening . the place looks like a dive , it 's a total hole in the wall , with no signs to speak of , but i liked the weird atmosphere of weird , old `` ghetto blasters '' on the walls and pics of arnold in terminator . it 's random , just go with it ... but the food ... .oh the food ! we were told that the squash poutine was a must have , so i ordered that and the bulgogi cheese steak , while my friend ordered the poutine and the mackerel . the mackerel was served first . it arrived raw , on a platter and a torch was taken to it to sear the outside and that was it . my friend allowed me a bite and it was so fresh tasting , with a delicious marinade . next came by bulgogi sandwich . fresh , delicious bread and amazing bulgogi . was very pleased . finally the `` poutines '' arrived . i should say that it was not what we were expecting . i assumed it would be squash on top of fries . but in fact the squash was the fries . they were lightly fried and covered in a variety of sauce `` gravies '' and scallions and some other stuff that i could neither make out , nor even see clearly ( dim lighting ) . it does n't matter okay ... .this stuff was heaven ! both my friend and i took a bite and looked at each other ... and proclaimed our new favourite food . other people in our party got the wings , which looked amazing and they said they were and the loosey , which was also proclaimed as delicious . so basically there were no wrong moves . the drink menu was very adventurous ... more so than we were , because we did n't take the plunge , although it was fun sitting at the bar and watching the bartender creating them . and splitting the bill for my friend with two others ( her birthday ) , my two `` tapas '' and a generic alcoholic beverage came to just under $ 30 . the prices are extremely reasonable ... and honestly once you try this stuff ... i mean , i do n't want to give them any ideas , but i would have paid more for that fine , fine food . i will be back . need me some more of that poutine !
DOC132 our friends got the groupon for four people and took us along . i 'm very pleased we went ! having never had ethiopian food before , we were curious , but wary . the deal really helped us dive in . it included two appetizers , four main courses and two desserts . we started with two appetizers , one i was n't a huge fan of ( a `` salad '' with a strong vinegar taste and jalapenos , which i found too strong , although other people in my group really liked it ) . the other appetizer was similar to an indian samosa ( similar name too , but i ca n't remember exactly what it was called ) . they were stuff with lentils and had a flaky shell . they were delicious . but , their appetizers were only made for three people , so there were only three of them ! seems silly when you offer a four person deal . we each ordered a different main course and they brought them on one large platter , so we could all share . we ordered two vegetarian options , one of lentils and one of chickpeas and one of chicken and one of beef . basically , the meals are more sauces than anything and they are served with injera , which are sort of bland , cold , bread-like stuff , which comes rolled up . they 're nothing special , but they 're only used as a sort of utensil , because you use it to scoop up the food . the food was delicious ! i especially liked the chickpea dish . every one of us ended up liking a different dish the best ! worked out well . i personally found the beef dish very tough though . once we were stuff with the food , we ordered two desserts . we especially liked the cheesecake ( which is obviously not ethiopian ) . we asked if they had any ethiopian coffees and they said yes . they showed us the beans , as they were being roasted . then they came back out with a sort of stone earthenware kettle and some small cups . the coffee was so rich , it was almost like chocolate . they also served it with a large basket of popcorn , which was just perfectly prepared . it was such a nice after dinner snack ! i would totally come here just to order the coffee ! it would have been a very expensive dinner without the groupon , so i 'm not sure i would make this a regularly destination , but as i said , the coffee was fantastic and it 's a fun thing to try , especially with friends . make sure they 're good ones , that you do n't mind getting messy in front of !
DOC133 a little on the pricey end for baked goods , but the baked goods are good . also their coffee products are great . the set up is annoying ( order your desserts on one side and coffee and food on another side ) , but the service is good and overall they do a good job .
DOC134 my sister told me that origin was well known for their delicious brunches , so we made a trip there to see if this was the case . origin is pretty new in our area and is very large , but nicely decorated . my only comment would be the washrooms , which feature communal sinks , the kind you find in elementary schools , where you step on the thing at the bottom and water comes out all around . besides not being very effective to quickly wash hands , it 's also wasteful if you 're the only one there . strange concept . throw back , but not necessarily one wants to remember during their brunch . now onto the important part ... the food and service . service started out alright and then immediately got very slow . it took some time to get our drink orders and then took a long time to get our actual orders . i ordered their french toast , my sister ordered tostada and my husband skipped brunch and ordered a meal they offered of a burger , fries covered in some chorizo and sauce and a float . i also ordered a side of bacon ... and was told that they were out of bacon ... which meant any orders that would have come with bacon were out entirely , or would be served without bacon . i 'm sorry but a brunch restaurant without bacon ? even the waitress admitted it was ridiculous . we also shared a plate of buscuits with their preserves . these were delicious . apparently my meal was the one that took the longest . the others got their food and we still waited for five minutes before mine came out . who knew it would take so long to put a couple of pieces of bread on a plate and cover them with blueberry preserves ? my sister said her tostada was quite good . my french toast was nothing special . the toast was `` fancy '' , rounded pieces , on top of each other with whipped cream and blueberries in between . the `` maple '' which was supposed to be on the plate ( maple syrup i 'm guessing ) was barely present . tasted like something i could have created with some ease . my husband 's dish was the best by far . his burger was juicy and this fries were great . the float was a little silly ... this big , meaty burger and fries covered in more meat ... paired with a cream soda float in pink and white layers . ( not insulting , we just got a laugh ) . nothing was cheap and then we had to wait a long time again to get our bill and pay . this was all strange because the restaurant was not particularly busy . because the brunch itself did n't blow me away , food shortages and service , i 'm not sure if i would bother with brunch again . oliver and bonicini in the actual mall has a much better brunch . i might try this again for lunch or dinner though .
DOC135 the saga has finished ... .because i needed to end this bs and move on .  so first off , the store owner responded to my complaints ... by blaming me . apparently it is my fault they sent the wrong thing , because i sent an email and then followed it up with a phone call ... which confused them and made them think there were two orders or something . which makes zero sense , because two orders were not sent . and the person i was speaking with on the phone responded to the emails i sent with codes to try out ... .so i have a hard time believing that they were confused by what was going on and thought that the phone order and email order were different .  they also told me they blocked me on instagram because i was body shaming their models . i want to be very clear on this . i never once body shamed , or made any comments on instagram about their models . i asked why they were promoting clothing they do n't even have in stock on instagram ... apparently that equates to body shaming to them .  they also informed me that because they had to mail so many orders to me ( 3 ) , they were going to start to charge me for shipping . they seemed to forget that i had also been paying to ship items back to them and that i had specifically chosen times when they had free shipping promos taking place to place orders . it 's not that they were n't charging me for shipping ... it was that i was taking advantage of their own promos . apparently i ca n't use their promos anymore , because they have placed an arbitrary rules on how many times you can make a return now . at least for me .  they did not address the code not working .  i responded and expressed continued frustration at their lack of ownership over their mistakes and how poor their customer service continued to be .  then i did some research and sent another email . instead of returning the dress i would donate it to dress for success . i said this seemed like a better choice than continuing to mail clothing back and forth . my request to them was that they take the would be money they would spend on continuing to mail me clothing and take some ownership for their mistakes and channel it into something good . i asked that they take the remaining $ 9.98 credit i had and put it towards them making a small donation , either monetarily or a piece of clothing , also to the charity . i stated that their continued neglect for customer service and lack of ownership over repeated problems should be owned up to , but if they would n't do it for me , perhaps they would be willing to do so for someone in need . i said that would conclude our business and bring something good out of this ridiculousness .  a few hours later i received an email with a letter of thanks for a donation made to dress for success ... for the amount of $ 10 via the store ... .so my remainder amount i had paid for and big sis closet 's contribution of ... .two cents . their generosity is astounding . now , i do n't know that they have n't made their own donation and just not told me of course ... i 'll let you guys decide whether you want to give them the benefit of the doubt in that regard . but given that they have taken zero responsibility for the continued poor management and customer service , well ... i think you can guess what my thoughts are on the subject . no further correspondence was sent from the actual store .  but at any rate , i am donating the new dress to dress for success ( along with my $ 9.98 ) and i am officially done with this store for good . and i sincerely hope that people read this review and think twice about shopping here . the clothes are not good quality , but more than that ... i have never experienced such insanely bad management and customer service in my life . zero regard for their customers , zero regard for their own mistakes , zero regard for taking ownership of ... anything ! just excuse after excuse and then turning the blame around on their customers . these people do not deserve your business and quite frankly ... ladies you deserve better . better clothing ( i have now purchased 6 items and been dissatisfied with the quality of all of them ... loose threads , flimsy , cheap fabric , wrong stitching for the fabric , no lining , incorrect fit for size , etc . ) and a greater degree of respect as a consumer .
DOC136 went here with my sister and her boyfriend for some drinks . we were hungry and ordered a few appetizers to share . drinks were fine ( my mix drink was on the very small side ) , but the food was really good . the perogies and `` chips '' and dip were excellent . the service was good and the atmosphere was nice , for such a small place . bathrooms were also nice , clean , etc . only problem is that some of the tables are so small , it 's really hard to use them . we were at a very small one and even though we fit around it alright , a guy walking by knocked a beer over with his coat and it dumped all down me . i mean all over me . it 's not the bar 's fault the guy knocked the glass , but if the table was a bit bigger we would have had more room to put the glass further in , so it would n't have gotten knocked in the first place . the fact is , if you 're going to serve food people need a place to put it . a few slightly bigger tables would go a long way .
DOC121 after being scared away from rock & rita 's , we ended up at this place , which was , if nothing else , quieter .  i 'll start by saying that the hostess and our server were both lovely and they 're really what earned the single star , because they were sweet , but the food was just horrible .  i ordered a simple grilled cheese sandwich . i asked the server if it was processed cheese , or `` real '' cheese in the sandwich and he had no idea what i was talking about . i tried to clarify by saying , `` is it like kraft single slices , or deli cheese ? '' he said it was `` good '' . this really should have been a sign and i could probably fault the waiter for this , since you should know what you 're serving , but he was so sweet , i could n't be mad !  my husband ordered a hot dog of sorts .  i asked if there was a way to substitute fries for a salad . there was not , but the server hooked me up and brought me a salad anyway ( no charge ) . i asked for sweet potato fries with the sandwich .  of course , my sandwich was made with plasticy , processed cheese , that was melted to the point of cheeze-wiz and was inedible . i took one bite of the sandwich and could n't do another . i got regular fries , instead of sweet potato ( did n't bother complaining , because i got the free salad , so whatever ... like i said , nice server ! ) my husband 's food was fine , although nothing special . they were good with the refills of our drinks .  anyway , as nice as the servers were , it was n't good . i would avoid eating here if i could .

DOC128 never eaten at this place before , but it 's always crowded and i decided that must mean something . i was running errands and had n't eaten the whole day , so decided to finally give this place a shot . i ordered a chicken sandwich and iced tea .  the iced tea does n't appear to be iced tea . it was a dark reddish colour and tasted like very watered down pomegranate juice . it was inedible . it was super gross . i was thinking that maybe they made a mistake , but i ca n't see on the menu anything else it might be and the girl who took my order , poured the drink and gave it to me said it was iced tea . sooooo ew .  sandwich was alright , but just alright . the `` aroma sauce '' which is a garlic mayo of sorts was good and the roasted red peppers and mozzerella on the sandwich were good . the bread was good , but the chicken was the sort of cheap , crappy chicken you find at subway , where it 's a sort of compressed chicken-like white meat , with fake grill marks on it . it had no taste and really took away from the overall sandwich .  there are soups , salads and of course hot beverages served at this place as well , so i 'm not writing it off just yet , but this was not a good first impression .
DOC129 solid soup place ... has an ever-so-slightly sketchy vibe to it ... you order your soup and the woman disappears into the back ... usually closes the sliding window so you ca n't see back there and then eventually emerges with your soup . also seems to sell a selection of jamaican movies in dvd from a glass case ... sort of random .  generous with the veggies , less so with dumplings , but all the soups have great flavour and are decently sized for the price . i wish they would offer some bread or crackers for the soup ... would be a nice , easy add-on . but this place is what it is and does n't bother with the bells and whistles . really deserves a 3.5 stars . the red bean is my fav by far .
DOC130 i would be more inclined to give this place 3-1\/2 stars , but since that 's not possible , i 'm rounding down .  i went here for sunday lunch with a group for winterlicious . for $ 15 we got a choice of appetizer , entree and dessert .  we arrived first and our table was waiting for us . the restaurant was not busy at that point and our waiter was very attentive with water and the wine menu .  once our party finally arrived we all ordered . i had their chipotle sweet potato & goat cheese dip , which was average . the salads looked much better and got better reviews . same with the soup . the dip was literally a dollap of dip at the side of the plate with some crostinis on the other end and 1 piece of pickled cauliflower and a few slices of onion in the middle . the dip was good , the pickled cauliflower alright . it was nice when all combined on the crostini ( pickled veggies , dip on top of crostini ) .  i had originally wanted to order the double pork slider , but i saw it arrive at someone else 's table and it was literally just the one , single mini pork sandwich , with a few thinly cut fries at the side . it looked good , but it was appetizer size , if that . the chicken sandwich was more reasonably sized , so i ordered that . it was good . i really liked the bread . the macaroni was also more reasonably sized . i sampled it and it was fine . did n't blow me away .  dessert was the highlight of the meal for everyone i think . some people ordered the mousse , which i thought was fine , but the people who ordered it loved , so there you have it . my husband loved his apple terrine , which i tried and was good . i liked the flavour of my creme brule very much , but the top was over toasted and had hardened to the consistency of a thin , hard candy . it was hard to break with my spoon and got stuck in my teeth .  the service was consistently good , so no complaints there . none of us had wine with our lunch ( although some had other drinks ) , so i ca n't comment there .  this is a tapas bar , so i expect sizes to be small . but when sizes are small i expect them to be priced accordingly and\/or to be in sharable portions . they gave the prices of each dish if you were to purchased them individually . these would all be hard to share and would n't really be worth it . they are nice as a winterlicious meal , but i 'm not sure this would be my first choice to go back to .
DOC121 after being scared away from rock & rita 's , we ended up at this place , which was , if nothing else , quieter .  i 'll start by saying that the hostess and our server were both lovely and they 're really what earned the single star , because they were sweet , but the food was just horrible .  i ordered a simple grilled cheese sandwich . i asked the server if it was processed cheese , or `` real '' cheese in the sandwich and he had no idea what i was talking about . i tried to clarify by saying , `` is it like kraft single slices , or deli cheese ? '' he said it was `` good '' . this really should have been a sign and i could probably fault the waiter for this , since you should know what you 're serving , but he was so sweet , i could n't be mad !  my husband ordered a hot dog of sorts .  i asked if there was a way to substitute fries for a salad . there was not , but the server hooked me up and brought me a salad anyway ( no charge ) . i asked for sweet potato fries with the sandwich .  of course , my sandwich was made with plasticy , processed cheese , that was melted to the point of cheeze-wiz and was inedible . i took one bite of the sandwich and could n't do another . i got regular fries , instead of sweet potato ( did n't bother complaining , because i got the free salad , so whatever ... like i said , nice server ! ) my husband 's food was fine , although nothing special . they were good with the refills of our drinks .  anyway , as nice as the servers were , it was n't good . i would avoid eating here if i could .
DOC122 we got recommendations for this place from my parents and so , for our anniversary , we booked here . we were told though that it was first come , first served , in terms of having the ideal seats by the windows that overlook the fountains of the bellagio and the strip . we went for lunch though , so it was n't too busy . we were seated by the window and were promptly served some sort of puffed rolls , with cheese and herbs infused . they were delicious !  we ordered the onion soup to start and i ordered parmesan chicken and my husband ordered a lamb burger . our food came and was delicious . the soup was probably my favorite part . we were feeling very full by the end and so declined dessert , but were still given some jellies and chocolate truffle and then were served a small chocolate mousse , on a decorated plate that said happy anniversary , which was a total surprise ( they had asked when i booked if it was a special occasion , but had said nothing while we were there ) . overall the service was great , the food delicious and the view wonderful . it was a great experience !
DOC123 i went here for the first time yesterday night to celebrate something with my family . several members of my family have been to this place before for summerlicious and really enjoyed it .  a nice atmosphere and excellent service , everyone ordered a variety of different dishes , many of which i tasted . i myself had a chicken salad and thought it was very good . my sister 's pasta dish was amazing though ! our waiter never rushed us out and was quick to refill water and bread and clear dishes , etc . that with an arm brace on !  prices are a little high , which is why i did n't give this place five stars ... i know those amazing places exist out there with great food and great prices , but this was a nice evening out .
DOC124 worst experience ever ! i had been there before to get my nails done and the first time was quite good , but the second time was a hot mess . it looked like a five year old did my nails for me . i went home and took the polish off . but this is the kicker : i could n't get an appointment for highlights at my regular salon and this was close by , so i decided to give it a try ( obviously the nail girl would n't be doing my hair ) . i went in and sat down the a woman with an eastern european accent came to talk with me . i showed her a picture of what i wanted and she showed me various hair dye samples ... .none of which looked like my picture , but i always assume the hair dressers know what 's best . now , you 're all thinking , `` ..and she did a poor job and you hated the colour ... '' right ? nope , she told me she could n't do my hair because i had lice ! of course i freaked out . another hair dresser came over to see if i was alright and i was mortified . she asked if i had experienced any itching . i said no . this hairdresser turned back to the original hairdresser and asked if maybe it was n't too bad yet , but original hairdresser said it was really , really bad . i freaked out and left ( obviously without having anything done ) and went to a shoppers and bought lice shampoo . i went home and had my husband look at my hair . he looked and looked and could find nothing . i still did n't want to take chances , so we tore the house apart and washed and bagged everything and i went to a walk-in clinic . the doctor looked at my head and also said there was nothing there ! since i was paranoid , i still used the shampoo and anytime my head itched in the slightest i went to examine it . but even with my husband and mother looking at my head , we never found a single thing . we did n't even see dandruff ! ! i went to a hairdresser a week later and they told me my hair was beautiful ... but dry at the ends ... yeah , because of the chemical-filled lice shampoo ! thanks a lot you crazy woman ! so ultimately , i never had lice . i do n't know if this woman just decided she did n't feel like doing my hair , or if she was delusional , but i sure wo n't be going back there ever again . no one else should either , unless you want to risk being embarrassed and inconvenienced .
DOC125 i love cupcakes . seriously ... .love affair ! so i 'm always on the lookout for new cupcake places . i was in scarborough town centre and came upon this kiosk . it 's not a storefront , but a rather ingenious booth , with colourful signs and a glass showcase full of cupcakes .  there is a long list of flavours and i suspect ( as with many places ) they make different cupcakes for different days .  i ordered 6 , which was $ 18 ... i know , it 's steep , that 's pretty standard . cupcake places seem to range from around the $ 2.25 mark to around $ 4\/cupcake . so these guys fall somewhere inbetween . but not cheap , so i expect excellence , needless to say .  now , here 's the strange thing . on their website each cupcake is listed as $ 2.90 ... .was this the case at the store ? ? i sure hope not . why would you have to pay more for buying more ? maybe it 's an ordering online thing ? anyway , my guess is that you 're paying $ 3\/cupcake at the store , or $ 18 for 6 . no real incentive to buy 6 . but i did , so moving on ... .  of course i chose a range of flavours : oreo cookie . chocolate with vanilla icing , salted caramel , lemon and a double chocolate .  over two days we managed to work our way through them ( myself and my husband ) and i nibbled the different flavours . lemon was my favorite , by far , with the salted caramel being a huge disappointment . it was entirely too salty . more salt than caramel . it was n't very good at all .  but that said , none of the cupcakes really blew me away . and in fact , they were very stale the next day , despite being stored in an airtight container , in the fridge . luckily , the cold buttercream frosting was easy to scoop off and once they had been in the oven for a few minutes , they softened up a bit .  the bottoms of the cupcakes stuck to the wrappers and the flavours were dull tasting and uninspired .  i was also surprised at the lack of creativity in terms of christmas flavours or designed . right before christmas you would expect some special flavours ... maybe a candy cane , or gingerbread cupcake . it would be so easy to switch out one flavour and try to get people to consider your product for a christmas party dessert .  having a little kiosk in a mall is a smart idea . sadly , this business is not one i think i will bother with again !

DOC131 i am surprised at the people complaining about the service , because we found the service to be fine . especially given how busy and cramped it was . there were no tables , but they got us seats at the bar . the music was maybe a little loud , but i enjoyed the 90s throwback that was happening . the place looks like a dive , it 's a total hole in the wall , with no signs to speak of , but i liked the weird atmosphere of weird , old `` ghetto blasters '' on the walls and pics of arnold in terminator . it 's random , just go with it ... but the food ... .oh the food ! we were told that the squash poutine was a must have , so i ordered that and the bulgogi cheese steak , while my friend ordered the poutine and the mackerel . the mackerel was served first . it arrived raw , on a platter and a torch was taken to it to sear the outside and that was it . my friend allowed me a bite and it was so fresh tasting , with a delicious marinade . next came by bulgogi sandwich . fresh , delicious bread and amazing bulgogi . was very pleased . finally the `` poutines '' arrived . i should say that it was not what we were expecting . i assumed it would be squash on top of fries . but in fact the squash was the fries . they were lightly fried and covered in a variety of sauce `` gravies '' and scallions and some other stuff that i could neither make out , nor even see clearly ( dim lighting ) . it does n't matter okay ... .this stuff was heaven ! both my friend and i took a bite and looked at each other ... and proclaimed our new favourite food . other people in our party got the wings , which looked amazing and they said they were and the loosey , which was also proclaimed as delicious . so basically there were no wrong moves . the drink menu was very adventurous ... more so than we were , because we did n't take the plunge , although it was fun sitting at the bar and watching the bartender creating them . and splitting the bill for my friend with two others ( her birthday ) , my two `` tapas '' and a generic alcoholic beverage came to just under $ 30 . the prices are extremely reasonable ... and honestly once you try this stuff ... i mean , i do n't want to give them any ideas , but i would have paid more for that fine , fine food . i will be back . need me some more of that poutine !
DOC132 our friends got the groupon for four people and took us along . i 'm very pleased we went ! having never had ethiopian food before , we were curious , but wary . the deal really helped us dive in . it included two appetizers , four main courses and two desserts . we started with two appetizers , one i was n't a huge fan of ( a `` salad '' with a strong vinegar taste and jalapenos , which i found too strong , although other people in my group really liked it ) . the other appetizer was similar to an indian samosa ( similar name too , but i ca n't remember exactly what it was called ) . they were stuff with lentils and had a flaky shell . they were delicious . but , their appetizers were only made for three people , so there were only three of them ! seems silly when you offer a four person deal . we each ordered a different main course and they brought them on one large platter , so we could all share . we ordered two vegetarian options , one of lentils and one of chickpeas and one of chicken and one of beef . basically , the meals are more sauces than anything and they are served with injera , which are sort of bland , cold , bread-like stuff , which comes rolled up . they 're nothing special , but they 're only used as a sort of utensil , because you use it to scoop up the food . the food was delicious ! i especially liked the chickpea dish . every one of us ended up liking a different dish the best ! worked out well . i personally found the beef dish very tough though . once we were stuff with the food , we ordered two desserts . we especially liked the cheesecake ( which is obviously not ethiopian ) . we asked if they had any ethiopian coffees and they said yes . they showed us the beans , as they were being roasted . then they came back out with a sort of stone earthenware kettle and some small cups . the coffee was so rich , it was almost like chocolate . they also served it with a large basket of popcorn , which was just perfectly prepared . it was such a nice after dinner snack ! i would totally come here just to order the coffee ! it would have been a very expensive dinner without the groupon , so i 'm not sure i would make this a regularly destination , but as i said , the coffee was fantastic and it 's a fun thing to try , especially with friends . make sure they 're good ones , that you do n't mind getting messy in front of !
DOC133 a little on the pricey end for baked goods , but the baked goods are good . also their coffee products are great . the set up is annoying ( order your desserts on one side and coffee and food on another side ) , but the service is good and overall they do a good job .
DOC134 my sister told me that origin was well known for their delicious brunches , so we made a trip there to see if this was the case . origin is pretty new in our area and is very large , but nicely decorated . my only comment would be the washrooms , which feature communal sinks , the kind you find in elementary schools , where you step on the thing at the bottom and water comes out all around . besides not being very effective to quickly wash hands , it 's also wasteful if you 're the only one there . strange concept . throw back , but not necessarily one wants to remember during their brunch . now onto the important part ... the food and service . service started out alright and then immediately got very slow . it took some time to get our drink orders and then took a long time to get our actual orders . i ordered their french toast , my sister ordered tostada and my husband skipped brunch and ordered a meal they offered of a burger , fries covered in some chorizo and sauce and a float . i also ordered a side of bacon ... and was told that they were out of bacon ... which meant any orders that would have come with bacon were out entirely , or would be served without bacon . i 'm sorry but a brunch restaurant without bacon ? even the waitress admitted it was ridiculous . we also shared a plate of buscuits with their preserves . these were delicious . apparently my meal was the one that took the longest . the others got their food and we still waited for five minutes before mine came out . who knew it would take so long to put a couple of pieces of bread on a plate and cover them with blueberry preserves ? my sister said her tostada was quite good . my french toast was nothing special . the toast was `` fancy '' , rounded pieces , on top of each other with whipped cream and blueberries in between . the `` maple '' which was supposed to be on the plate ( maple syrup i 'm guessing ) was barely present . tasted like something i could have created with some ease . my husband 's dish was the best by far . his burger was juicy and this fries were great . the float was a little silly ... this big , meaty burger and fries covered in more meat ... paired with a cream soda float in pink and white layers . ( not insulting , we just got a laugh ) . nothing was cheap and then we had to wait a long time again to get our bill and pay . this was all strange because the restaurant was not particularly busy . because the brunch itself did n't blow me away , food shortages and service , i 'm not sure if i would bother with brunch again . oliver and bonicini in the actual mall has a much better brunch . i might try this again for lunch or dinner though .
DOC135 the saga has finished ... .because i needed to end this bs and move on .  so first off , the store owner responded to my complaints ... by blaming me . apparently it is my fault they sent the wrong thing , because i sent an email and then followed it up with a phone call ... which confused them and made them think there were two orders or something . which makes zero sense , because two orders were not sent . and the person i was speaking with on the phone responded to the emails i sent with codes to try out ... .so i have a hard time believing that they were confused by what was going on and thought that the phone order and email order were different .  they also told me they blocked me on instagram because i was body shaming their models . i want to be very clear on this . i never once body shamed , or made any comments on instagram about their models . i asked why they were promoting clothing they do n't even have in stock on instagram ... apparently that equates to body shaming to them .  they also informed me that because they had to mail so many orders to me ( 3 ) , they were going to start to charge me for shipping . they seemed to forget that i had also been paying to ship items back to them and that i had specifically chosen times when they had free shipping promos taking place to place orders . it 's not that they were n't charging me for shipping ... it was that i was taking advantage of their own promos . apparently i ca n't use their promos anymore , because they have placed an arbitrary rules on how many times you can make a return now . at least for me .  they did not address the code not working .  i responded and expressed continued frustration at their lack of ownership over their mistakes and how poor their customer service continued to be .  then i did some research and sent another email . instead of returning the dress i would donate it to dress for success . i said this seemed like a better choice than continuing to mail clothing back and forth . my request to them was that they take the would be money they would spend on continuing to mail me clothing and take some ownership for their mistakes and channel it into something good . i asked that they take the remaining $ 9.98 credit i had and put it towards them making a small donation , either monetarily or a piece of clothing , also to the charity . i stated that their continued neglect for customer service and lack of ownership over repeated problems should be owned up to , but if they would n't do it for me , perhaps they would be willing to do so for someone in need . i said that would conclude our business and bring something good out of this ridiculousness .  a few hours later i received an email with a letter of thanks for a donation made to dress for success ... for the amount of $ 10 via the store ... .so my remainder amount i had paid for and big sis closet 's contribution of ... .two cents . their generosity is astounding . now , i do n't know that they have n't made their own donation and just not told me of course ... i 'll let you guys decide whether you want to give them the benefit of the doubt in that regard . but given that they have taken zero responsibility for the continued poor management and customer service , well ... i think you can guess what my thoughts are on the subject . no further correspondence was sent from the actual store .  but at any rate , i am donating the new dress to dress for success ( along with my $ 9.98 ) and i am officially done with this store for good . and i sincerely hope that people read this review and think twice about shopping here . the clothes are not good quality , but more than that ... i have never experienced such insanely bad management and customer service in my life . zero regard for their customers , zero regard for their own mistakes , zero regard for taking ownership of ... anything ! just excuse after excuse and then turning the blame around on their customers . these people do not deserve your business and quite frankly ... ladies you deserve better . better clothing ( i have now purchased 6 items and been dissatisfied with the quality of all of them ... loose threads , flimsy , cheap fabric , wrong stitching for the fabric , no lining , incorrect fit for size , etc . ) and a greater degree of respect as a consumer .
DOC136 went here with my sister and her boyfriend for some drinks . we were hungry and ordered a few appetizers to share . drinks were fine ( my mix drink was on the very small side ) , but the food was really good . the perogies and `` chips '' and dip were excellent . the service was good and the atmosphere was nice , for such a small place . bathrooms were also nice , clean , etc . only problem is that some of the tables are so small , it 's really hard to use them . we were at a very small one and even though we fit around it alright , a guy walking by knocked a beer over with his coat and it dumped all down me . i mean all over me . it 's not the bar 's fault the guy knocked the glass , but if the table was a bit bigger we would have had more room to put the glass further in , so it would n't have gotten knocked in the first place . the fact is , if you 're going to serve food people need a place to put it . a few slightly bigger tables would go a long way .

DOC122 we got recommendations for this place from my parents and so , for our anniversary , we booked here . we were told though that it was first come , first served , in terms of having the ideal seats by the windows that overlook the fountains of the bellagio and the strip . we went for lunch though , so it was n't too busy . we were seated by the window and were promptly served some sort of puffed rolls , with cheese and herbs infused . they were delicious !  we ordered the onion soup to start and i ordered parmesan chicken and my husband ordered a lamb burger . our food came and was delicious . the soup was probably my favorite part . we were feeling very full by the end and so declined dessert , but were still given some jellies and chocolate truffle and then were served a small chocolate mousse , on a decorated plate that said happy anniversary , which was a total surprise ( they had asked when i booked if it was a special occasion , but had said nothing while we were there ) . overall the service was great , the food delicious and the view wonderful . it was a great experience !
DOC123 i went here for the first time yesterday night to celebrate something with my family . several members of my family have been to this place before for summerlicious and really enjoyed it .  a nice atmosphere and excellent service , everyone ordered a variety of different dishes , many of which i tasted . i myself had a chicken salad and thought it was very good . my sister 's pasta dish was amazing though ! our waiter never rushed us out and was quick to refill water and bread and clear dishes , etc . that with an arm brace on !  prices are a little high , which is why i did n't give this place five stars ... i know those amazing places exist out there with great food and great prices , but this was a nice evening out .
DOC124 worst experience ever ! i had been there before to get my nails done and the first time was quite good , but the second time was a hot mess . it looked like a five year old did my nails for me . i went home and took the polish off . but this is the kicker : i could n't get an appointment for highlights at my regular salon and this was close by , so i decided to give it a try ( obviously the nail girl would n't be doing my hair ) . i went in and sat down the a woman with an eastern european accent came to talk with me . i showed her a picture of what i wanted and she showed me various hair dye samples ... .none of which looked like my picture , but i always assume the hair dressers know what 's best . now , you 're all thinking , `` ..and she did a poor job and you hated the colour ... '' right ? nope , she told me she could n't do my hair because i had lice ! of course i freaked out . another hair dresser came over to see if i was alright and i was mortified . she asked if i had experienced any itching . i said no . this hairdresser turned back to the original hairdresser and asked if maybe it was n't too bad yet , but original hairdresser said it was really , really bad . i freaked out and left ( obviously without having anything done ) and went to a shoppers and bought lice shampoo . i went home and had my husband look at my hair . he looked and looked and could find nothing . i still did n't want to take chances , so we tore the house apart and washed and bagged everything and i went to a walk-in clinic . the doctor looked at my head and also said there was nothing there ! since i was paranoid , i still used the shampoo and anytime my head itched in the slightest i went to examine it . but even with my husband and mother looking at my head , we never found a single thing . we did n't even see dandruff ! ! i went to a hairdresser a week later and they told me my hair was beautiful ... but dry at the ends ... yeah , because of the chemical-filled lice shampoo ! thanks a lot you crazy woman ! so ultimately , i never had lice . i do n't know if this woman just decided she did n't feel like doing my hair , or if she was delusional , but i sure wo n't be going back there ever again . no one else should either , unless you want to risk being embarrassed and inconvenienced .
DOC125 i love cupcakes . seriously ... .love affair ! so i 'm always on the lookout for new cupcake places . i was in scarborough town centre and came upon this kiosk . it 's not a storefront , but a rather ingenious booth , with colourful signs and a glass showcase full of cupcakes .  there is a long list of flavours and i suspect ( as with many places ) they make different cupcakes for different days .  i ordered 6 , which was $ 18 ... i know , it 's steep , that 's pretty standard . cupcake places seem to range from around the $ 2.25 mark to around $ 4\/cupcake . so these guys fall somewhere inbetween . but not cheap , so i expect excellence , needless to say .  now , here 's the strange thing . on their website each cupcake is listed as $ 2.90 ... .was this the case at the store ? ? i sure hope not . why would you have to pay more for buying more ? maybe it 's an ordering online thing ? anyway , my guess is that you 're paying $ 3\/cupcake at the store , or $ 18 for 6 . no real incentive to buy 6 . but i did , so moving on ... .  of course i chose a range of flavours : oreo cookie . chocolate with vanilla icing , salted caramel , lemon and a double chocolate .  over two days we managed to work our way through them ( myself and my husband ) and i nibbled the different flavours . lemon was my favorite , by far , with the salted caramel being a huge disappointment . it was entirely too salty . more salt than caramel . it was n't very good at all .  but that said , none of the cupcakes really blew me away . and in fact , they were very stale the next day , despite being stored in an airtight container , in the fridge . luckily , the cold buttercream frosting was easy to scoop off and once they had been in the oven for a few minutes , they softened up a bit .  the bottoms of the cupcakes stuck to the wrappers and the flavours were dull tasting and uninspired .  i was also surprised at the lack of creativity in terms of christmas flavours or designed . right before christmas you would expect some special flavours ... maybe a candy cane , or gingerbread cupcake . it would be so easy to switch out one flavour and try to get people to consider your product for a christmas party dessert .  having a little kiosk in a mall is a smart idea . sadly , this business is not one i think i will bother with again !
DOC126 i had a craving for mexican and came here ( ie . yelp ) to figure out what we could do , because there is a very real lack of good mexican food in toronto . this place had some good reviews and was n't too far away from us , so off we went .  parking in leaside can be pretty brutal , but we finally found a space and luckily , street parking is free .  the restaurant is tacky , stereotypical , but cozy and we were quickly greeted and seated .  the menu has basic mexican fare , burritos , fajitas , tacos , with your choice of meat . nothing too outside of the box , but that 's not necessarily a bad thing .  we ordered the guacamole to start and i ordered a chicken enchilada and my husband ordered the chimichanga .  the guacamole is very delicious and creamy , but we had to ask for more nachos and even then it felt like not enough . we were really loading up the chips with the guacamole !  the food came out and the was served with rice , a salad ( sort of italian dressing with feta and tomatoes ) and refried beans . the salad was pretty generic and the rice was bland , but the actual main courses were great and the refried beans helped with the spice ( i 'm a wimp ) .  the appetizer and our main courses came to $ 30 and we were very full .  service was good and food was good and it was n't too expensive . it was n't perfect , but we 'll totally be back !
DOC127 came here with my mother , husband and baby for brunch\/lunch . we were all quite happy with our choice . i think i was the `` winner '' by ordering the french toast . it was practically half a loaf of bread , covered with fruit and with delicious cinnamon butter . my husband ordered the stoney 's breakfast , which is your basic eggs , toast , bacon , etc , meal . my mother ordered the omelet . huge portions , but at around $ 11- $ 13 per breakfast meal , it was on the steep end of brunches and other than mine , i 'm not sure the price is warranted , especially since it 's a order at the counter , then find a seat with your number and wait for your meal type place . people were friendly and service was good ( for what it was ) . i would give it a try if i was in the area again .
DOC128 never eaten at this place before , but it 's always crowded and i decided that must mean something . i was running errands and had n't eaten the whole day , so decided to finally give this place a shot . i ordered a chicken sandwich and iced tea .  the iced tea does n't appear to be iced tea . it was a dark reddish colour and tasted like very watered down pomegranate juice . it was inedible . it was super gross . i was thinking that maybe they made a mistake , but i ca n't see on the menu anything else it might be and the girl who took my order , poured the drink and gave it to me said it was iced tea . sooooo ew .  sandwich was alright , but just alright . the `` aroma sauce '' which is a garlic mayo of sorts was good and the roasted red peppers and mozzerella on the sandwich were good . the bread was good , but the chicken was the sort of cheap , crappy chicken you find at subway , where it 's a sort of compressed chicken-like white meat , with fake grill marks on it . it had no taste and really took away from the overall sandwich .  there are soups , salads and of course hot beverages served at this place as well , so i 'm not writing it off just yet , but this was not a good first impression .
DOC129 solid soup place ... has an ever-so-slightly sketchy vibe to it ... you order your soup and the woman disappears into the back ... usually closes the sliding window so you ca n't see back there and then eventually emerges with your soup . also seems to sell a selection of jamaican movies in dvd from a glass case ... sort of random .  generous with the veggies , less so with dumplings , but all the soups have great flavour and are decently sized for the price . i wish they would offer some bread or crackers for the soup ... would be a nice , easy add-on . but this place is what it is and does n't bother with the bells and whistles . really deserves a 3.5 stars . the red bean is my fav by far .
DOC130 i would be more inclined to give this place 3-1\/2 stars , but since that 's not possible , i 'm rounding down .  i went here for sunday lunch with a group for winterlicious . for $ 15 we got a choice of appetizer , entree and dessert .  we arrived first and our table was waiting for us . the restaurant was not busy at that point and our waiter was very attentive with water and the wine menu .  once our party finally arrived we all ordered . i had their chipotle sweet potato & goat cheese dip , which was average . the salads looked much better and got better reviews . same with the soup . the dip was literally a dollap of dip at the side of the plate with some crostinis on the other end and 1 piece of pickled cauliflower and a few slices of onion in the middle . the dip was good , the pickled cauliflower alright . it was nice when all combined on the crostini ( pickled veggies , dip on top of crostini ) .  i had originally wanted to order the double pork slider , but i saw it arrive at someone else 's table and it was literally just the one , single mini pork sandwich , with a few thinly cut fries at the side . it looked good , but it was appetizer size , if that . the chicken sandwich was more reasonably sized , so i ordered that . it was good . i really liked the bread . the macaroni was also more reasonably sized . i sampled it and it was fine . did n't blow me away .  dessert was the highlight of the meal for everyone i think . some people ordered the mousse , which i thought was fine , but the people who ordered it loved , so there you have it . my husband loved his apple terrine , which i tried and was good . i liked the flavour of my creme brule very much , but the top was over toasted and had hardened to the consistency of a thin , hard candy . it was hard to break with my spoon and got stuck in my teeth .  the service was consistently good , so no complaints there . none of us had wine with our lunch ( although some had other drinks ) , so i ca n't comment there .  this is a tapas bar , so i expect sizes to be small . but when sizes are small i expect them to be priced accordingly and\/or to be in sharable portions . they gave the prices of each dish if you were to purchased them individually . these would all be hard to share and would n't really be worth it . they are nice as a winterlicious meal , but i 'm not sure this would be my first choice to go back to .
DOC131 i am surprised at the people complaining about the service , because we found the service to be fine . especially given how busy and cramped it was . there were no tables , but they got us seats at the bar . the music was maybe a little loud , but i enjoyed the 90s throwback that was happening . the place looks like a dive , it 's a total hole in the wall , with no signs to speak of , but i liked the weird atmosphere of weird , old `` ghetto blasters '' on the walls and pics of arnold in terminator . it 's random , just go with it ... but the food ... .oh the food ! we were told that the squash poutine was a must have , so i ordered that and the bulgogi cheese steak , while my friend ordered the poutine and the mackerel . the mackerel was served first . it arrived raw , on a platter and a torch was taken to it to sear the outside and that was it . my friend allowed me a bite and it was so fresh tasting , with a delicious marinade . next came by bulgogi sandwich . fresh , delicious bread and amazing bulgogi . was very pleased . finally the `` poutines '' arrived . i should say that it was not what we were expecting . i assumed it would be squash on top of fries . but in fact the squash was the fries . they were lightly fried and covered in a variety of sauce `` gravies '' and scallions and some other stuff that i could neither make out , nor even see clearly ( dim lighting ) . it does n't matter okay ... .this stuff was heaven ! both my friend and i took a bite and looked at each other ... and proclaimed our new favourite food . other people in our party got the wings , which looked amazing and they said they were and the loosey , which was also proclaimed as delicious . so basically there were no wrong moves . the drink menu was very adventurous ... more so than we were , because we did n't take the plunge , although it was fun sitting at the bar and watching the bartender creating them . and splitting the bill for my friend with two others ( her birthday ) , my two `` tapas '' and a generic alcoholic beverage came to just under $ 30 . the prices are extremely reasonable ... and honestly once you try this stuff ... i mean , i do n't want to give them any ideas , but i would have paid more for that fine , fine food . i will be back . need me some more of that poutine !
DOC132 our friends got the groupon for four people and took us along . i 'm very pleased we went ! having never had ethiopian food before , we were curious , but wary . the deal really helped us dive in . it included two appetizers , four main courses and two desserts . we started with two appetizers , one i was n't a huge fan of ( a `` salad '' with a strong vinegar taste and jalapenos , which i found too strong , although other people in my group really liked it ) . the other appetizer was similar to an indian samosa ( similar name too , but i ca n't remember exactly what it was called ) . they were stuff with lentils and had a flaky shell . they were delicious . but , their appetizers were only made for three people , so there were only three of them ! seems silly when you offer a four person deal . we each ordered a different main course and they brought them on one large platter , so we could all share . we ordered two vegetarian options , one of lentils and one of chickpeas and one of chicken and one of beef . basically , the meals are more sauces than anything and they are served with injera , which are sort of bland , cold , bread-like stuff , which comes rolled up . they 're nothing special , but they 're only used as a sort of utensil , because you use it to scoop up the food . the food was delicious ! i especially liked the chickpea dish . every one of us ended up liking a different dish the best ! worked out well . i personally found the beef dish very tough though . once we were stuff with the food , we ordered two desserts . we especially liked the cheesecake ( which is obviously not ethiopian ) . we asked if they had any ethiopian coffees and they said yes . they showed us the beans , as they were being roasted . then they came back out with a sort of stone earthenware kettle and some small cups . the coffee was so rich , it was almost like chocolate . they also served it with a large basket of popcorn , which was just perfectly prepared . it was such a nice after dinner snack ! i would totally come here just to order the coffee ! it would have been a very expensive dinner without the groupon , so i 'm not sure i would make this a regularly destination , but as i said , the coffee was fantastic and it 's a fun thing to try , especially with friends . make sure they 're good ones , that you do n't mind getting messy in front of !
DOC133 a little on the pricey end for baked goods , but the baked goods are good . also their coffee products are great . the set up is annoying ( order your desserts on one side and coffee and food on another side ) , but the service is good and overall they do a good job .
DOC134 my sister told me that origin was well known for their delicious brunches , so we made a trip there to see if this was the case . origin is pretty new in our area and is very large , but nicely decorated . my only comment would be the washrooms , which feature communal sinks , the kind you find in elementary schools , where you step on the thing at the bottom and water comes out all around . besides not being very effective to quickly wash hands , it 's also wasteful if you 're the only one there . strange concept . throw back , but not necessarily one wants to remember during their brunch . now onto the important part ... the food and service . service started out alright and then immediately got very slow . it took some time to get our drink orders and then took a long time to get our actual orders . i ordered their french toast , my sister ordered tostada and my husband skipped brunch and ordered a meal they offered of a burger , fries covered in some chorizo and sauce and a float . i also ordered a side of bacon ... and was told that they were out of bacon ... which meant any orders that would have come with bacon were out entirely , or would be served without bacon . i 'm sorry but a brunch restaurant without bacon ? even the waitress admitted it was ridiculous . we also shared a plate of buscuits with their preserves . these were delicious . apparently my meal was the one that took the longest . the others got their food and we still waited for five minutes before mine came out . who knew it would take so long to put a couple of pieces of bread on a plate and cover them with blueberry preserves ? my sister said her tostada was quite good . my french toast was nothing special . the toast was `` fancy '' , rounded pieces , on top of each other with whipped cream and blueberries in between . the `` maple '' which was supposed to be on the plate ( maple syrup i 'm guessing ) was barely present . tasted like something i could have created with some ease . my husband 's dish was the best by far . his burger was juicy and this fries were great . the float was a little silly ... this big , meaty burger and fries covered in more meat ... paired with a cream soda float in pink and white layers . ( not insulting , we just got a laugh ) . nothing was cheap and then we had to wait a long time again to get our bill and pay . this was all strange because the restaurant was not particularly busy . because the brunch itself did n't blow me away , food shortages and service , i 'm not sure if i would bother with brunch again . oliver and bonicini in the actual mall has a much better brunch . i might try this again for lunch or dinner though .
DOC135 the saga has finished ... .because i needed to end this bs and move on .  so first off , the store owner responded to my complaints ... by blaming me . apparently it is my fault they sent the wrong thing , because i sent an email and then followed it up with a phone call ... which confused them and made them think there were two orders or something . which makes zero sense , because two orders were not sent . and the person i was speaking with on the phone responded to the emails i sent with codes to try out ... .so i have a hard time believing that they were confused by what was going on and thought that the phone order and email order were different .  they also told me they blocked me on instagram because i was body shaming their models . i want to be very clear on this . i never once body shamed , or made any comments on instagram about their models . i asked why they were promoting clothing they do n't even have in stock on instagram ... apparently that equates to body shaming to them .  they also informed me that because they had to mail so many orders to me ( 3 ) , they were going to start to charge me for shipping . they seemed to forget that i had also been paying to ship items back to them and that i had specifically chosen times when they had free shipping promos taking place to place orders . it 's not that they were n't charging me for shipping ... it was that i was taking advantage of their own promos . apparently i ca n't use their promos anymore , because they have placed an arbitrary rules on how many times you can make a return now . at least for me .  they did not address the code not working .  i responded and expressed continued frustration at their lack of ownership over their mistakes and how poor their customer service continued to be .  then i did some research and sent another email . instead of returning the dress i would donate it to dress for success . i said this seemed like a better choice than continuing to mail clothing back and forth . my request to them was that they take the would be money they would spend on continuing to mail me clothing and take some ownership for their mistakes and channel it into something good . i asked that they take the remaining $ 9.98 credit i had and put it towards them making a small donation , either monetarily or a piece of clothing , also to the charity . i stated that their continued neglect for customer service and lack of ownership over repeated problems should be owned up to , but if they would n't do it for me , perhaps they would be willing to do so for someone in need . i said that would conclude our business and bring something good out of this ridiculousness .  a few hours later i received an email with a letter of thanks for a donation made to dress for success ... for the amount of $ 10 via the store ... .so my remainder amount i had paid for and big sis closet 's contribution of ... .two cents . their generosity is astounding . now , i do n't know that they have n't made their own donation and just not told me of course ... i 'll let you guys decide whether you want to give them the benefit of the doubt in that regard . but given that they have taken zero responsibility for the continued poor management and customer service , well ... i think you can guess what my thoughts are on the subject . no further correspondence was sent from the actual store .  but at any rate , i am donating the new dress to dress for success ( along with my $ 9.98 ) and i am officially done with this store for good . and i sincerely hope that people read this review and think twice about shopping here . the clothes are not good quality , but more than that ... i have never experienced such insanely bad management and customer service in my life . zero regard for their customers , zero regard for their own mistakes , zero regard for taking ownership of ... anything ! just excuse after excuse and then turning the blame around on their customers . these people do not deserve your business and quite frankly ... ladies you deserve better . better clothing ( i have now purchased 6 items and been dissatisfied with the quality of all of them ... loose threads , flimsy , cheap fabric , wrong stitching for the fabric , no lining , incorrect fit for size , etc . ) and a greater degree of respect as a consumer .
DOC136 went here with my sister and her boyfriend for some drinks . we were hungry and ordered a few appetizers to share . drinks were fine ( my mix drink was on the very small side ) , but the food was really good . the perogies and `` chips '' and dip were excellent . the service was good and the atmosphere was nice , for such a small place . bathrooms were also nice , clean , etc . only problem is that some of the tables are so small , it 's really hard to use them . we were at a very small one and even though we fit around it alright , a guy walking by knocked a beer over with his coat and it dumped all down me . i mean all over me . it 's not the bar 's fault the guy knocked the glass , but if the table was a bit bigger we would have had more room to put the glass further in , so it would n't have gotten knocked in the first place . the fact is , if you 're going to serve food people need a place to put it . a few slightly bigger tables would go a long way .

DOC126 i had a craving for mexican and came here ( ie . yelp ) to figure out what we could do , because there is a very real lack of good mexican food in toronto . this place had some good reviews and was n't too far away from us , so off we went .  parking in leaside can be pretty brutal , but we finally found a space and luckily , street parking is free .  the restaurant is tacky , stereotypical , but cozy and we were quickly greeted and seated .  the menu has basic mexican fare , burritos , fajitas , tacos , with your choice of meat . nothing too outside of the box , but that 's not necessarily a bad thing .  we ordered the guacamole to start and i ordered a chicken enchilada and my husband ordered the chimichanga .  the guacamole is very delicious and creamy , but we had to ask for more nachos and even then it felt like not enough . we were really loading up the chips with the guacamole !  the food came out and the was served with rice , a salad ( sort of italian dressing with feta and tomatoes ) and refried beans . the salad was pretty generic and the rice was bland , but the actual main courses were great and the refried beans helped with the spice ( i 'm a wimp ) .  the appetizer and our main courses came to $ 30 and we were very full .  service was good and food was good and it was n't too expensive . it was n't perfect , but we 'll totally be back !
DOC127 came here with my mother , husband and baby for brunch\/lunch . we were all quite happy with our choice . i think i was the `` winner '' by ordering the french toast . it was practically half a loaf of bread , covered with fruit and with delicious cinnamon butter . my husband ordered the stoney 's breakfast , which is your basic eggs , toast , bacon , etc , meal . my mother ordered the omelet . huge portions , but at around $ 11- $ 13 per breakfast meal , it was on the steep end of brunches and other than mine , i 'm not sure the price is warranted , especially since it 's a order at the counter , then find a seat with your number and wait for your meal type place . people were friendly and service was good ( for what it was ) . i would give it a try if i was in the area again .
DOC128 never eaten at this place before , but it 's always crowded and i decided that must mean something . i was running errands and had n't eaten the whole day , so decided to finally give this place a shot . i ordered a chicken sandwich and iced tea .  the iced tea does n't appear to be iced tea . it was a dark reddish colour and tasted like very watered down pomegranate juice . it was inedible . it was super gross . i was thinking that maybe they made a mistake , but i ca n't see on the menu anything else it might be and the girl who took my order , poured the drink and gave it to me said it was iced tea . sooooo ew .  sandwich was alright , but just alright . the `` aroma sauce '' which is a garlic mayo of sorts was good and the roasted red peppers and mozzerella on the sandwich were good . the bread was good , but the chicken was the sort of cheap , crappy chicken you find at subway , where it 's a sort of compressed chicken-like white meat , with fake grill marks on it . it had no taste and really took away from the overall sandwich .  there are soups , salads and of course hot beverages served at this place as well , so i 'm not writing it off just yet , but this was not a good first impression .
DOC129 solid soup place ... has an ever-so-slightly sketchy vibe to it ... you order your soup and the woman disappears into the back ... usually closes the sliding window so you ca n't see back there and then eventually emerges with your soup . also seems to sell a selection of jamaican movies in dvd from a glass case ... sort of random .  generous with the veggies , less so with dumplings , but all the soups have great flavour and are decently sized for the price . i wish they would offer some bread or crackers for the soup ... would be a nice , easy add-on . but this place is what it is and does n't bother with the bells and whistles . really deserves a 3.5 stars . the red bean is my fav by far .
DOC130 i would be more inclined to give this place 3-1\/2 stars , but since that 's not possible , i 'm rounding down .  i went here for sunday lunch with a group for winterlicious . for $ 15 we got a choice of appetizer , entree and dessert .  we arrived first and our table was waiting for us . the restaurant was not busy at that point and our waiter was very attentive with water and the wine menu .  once our party finally arrived we all ordered . i had their chipotle sweet potato & goat cheese dip , which was average . the salads looked much better and got better reviews . same with the soup . the dip was literally a dollap of dip at the side of the plate with some crostinis on the other end and 1 piece of pickled cauliflower and a few slices of onion in the middle . the dip was good , the pickled cauliflower alright . it was nice when all combined on the crostini ( pickled veggies , dip on top of crostini ) .  i had originally wanted to order the double pork slider , but i saw it arrive at someone else 's table and it was literally just the one , single mini pork sandwich , with a few thinly cut fries at the side . it looked good , but it was appetizer size , if that . the chicken sandwich was more reasonably sized , so i ordered that . it was good . i really liked the bread . the macaroni was also more reasonably sized . i sampled it and it was fine . did n't blow me away .  dessert was the highlight of the meal for everyone i think . some people ordered the mousse , which i thought was fine , but the people who ordered it loved , so there you have it . my husband loved his apple terrine , which i tried and was good . i liked the flavour of my creme brule very much , but the top was over toasted and had hardened to the consistency of a thin , hard candy . it was hard to break with my spoon and got stuck in my teeth .  the service was consistently good , so no complaints there . none of us had wine with our lunch ( although some had other drinks ) , so i ca n't comment there .  this is a tapas bar , so i expect sizes to be small . but when sizes are small i expect them to be priced accordingly and\/or to be in sharable portions . they gave the prices of each dish if you were to purchased them individually . these would all be hard to share and would n't really be worth it . they are nice as a winterlicious meal , but i 'm not sure this would be my first choice to go back to .
DOC121 after being scared away from rock & rita 's , we ended up at this place , which was , if nothing else , quieter .  i 'll start by saying that the hostess and our server were both lovely and they 're really what earned the single star , because they were sweet , but the food was just horrible .  i ordered a simple grilled cheese sandwich . i asked the server if it was processed cheese , or `` real '' cheese in the sandwich and he had no idea what i was talking about . i tried to clarify by saying , `` is it like kraft single slices , or deli cheese ? '' he said it was `` good '' . this really should have been a sign and i could probably fault the waiter for this , since you should know what you 're serving , but he was so sweet , i could n't be mad !  my husband ordered a hot dog of sorts .  i asked if there was a way to substitute fries for a salad . there was not , but the server hooked me up and brought me a salad anyway ( no charge ) . i asked for sweet potato fries with the sandwich .  of course , my sandwich was made with plasticy , processed cheese , that was melted to the point of cheeze-wiz and was inedible . i took one bite of the sandwich and could n't do another . i got regular fries , instead of sweet potato ( did n't bother complaining , because i got the free salad , so whatever ... like i said , nice server ! ) my husband 's food was fine , although nothing special . they were good with the refills of our drinks .  anyway , as nice as the servers were , it was n't good . i would avoid eating here if i could .
DOC122 we got recommendations for this place from my parents and so , for our anniversary , we booked here . we were told though that it was first come , first served , in terms of having the ideal seats by the windows that overlook the fountains of the bellagio and the strip . we went for lunch though , so it was n't too busy . we were seated by the window and were promptly served some sort of puffed rolls , with cheese and herbs infused . they were delicious !  we ordered the onion soup to start and i ordered parmesan chicken and my husband ordered a lamb burger . our food came and was delicious . the soup was probably my favorite part . we were feeling very full by the end and so declined dessert , but were still given some jellies and chocolate truffle and then were served a small chocolate mousse , on a decorated plate that said happy anniversary , which was a total surprise ( they had asked when i booked if it was a special occasion , but had said nothing while we were there ) . overall the service was great , the food delicious and the view wonderful . it was a great experience !
DOC123 i went here for the first time yesterday night to celebrate something with my family . several members of my family have been to this place before for summerlicious and really enjoyed it .  a nice atmosphere and excellent service , everyone ordered a variety of different dishes , many of which i tasted . i myself had a chicken salad and thought it was very good . my sister 's pasta dish was amazing though ! our waiter never rushed us out and was quick to refill water and bread and clear dishes , etc . that with an arm brace on !  prices are a little high , which is why i did n't give this place five stars ... i know those amazing places exist out there with great food and great prices , but this was a nice evening out .
DOC124 worst experience ever ! i had been there before to get my nails done and the first time was quite good , but the second time was a hot mess . it looked like a five year old did my nails for me . i went home and took the polish off . but this is the kicker : i could n't get an appointment for highlights at my regular salon and this was close by , so i decided to give it a try ( obviously the nail girl would n't be doing my hair ) . i went in and sat down the a woman with an eastern european accent came to talk with me . i showed her a picture of what i wanted and she showed me various hair dye samples ... .none of which looked like my picture , but i always assume the hair dressers know what 's best . now , you 're all thinking , `` ..and she did a poor job and you hated the colour ... '' right ? nope , she told me she could n't do my hair because i had lice ! of course i freaked out . another hair dresser came over to see if i was alright and i was mortified . she asked if i had experienced any itching . i said no . this hairdresser turned back to the original hairdresser and asked if maybe it was n't too bad yet , but original hairdresser said it was really , really bad . i freaked out and left ( obviously without having anything done ) and went to a shoppers and bought lice shampoo . i went home and had my husband look at my hair . he looked and looked and could find nothing . i still did n't want to take chances , so we tore the house apart and washed and bagged everything and i went to a walk-in clinic . the doctor looked at my head and also said there was nothing there ! since i was paranoid , i still used the shampoo and anytime my head itched in the slightest i went to examine it . but even with my husband and mother looking at my head , we never found a single thing . we did n't even see dandruff ! ! i went to a hairdresser a week later and they told me my hair was beautiful ... but dry at the ends ... yeah , because of the chemical-filled lice shampoo ! thanks a lot you crazy woman ! so ultimately , i never had lice . i do n't know if this woman just decided she did n't feel like doing my hair , or if she was delusional , but i sure wo n't be going back there ever again . no one else should either , unless you want to risk being embarrassed and inconvenienced .

DOC131 i am surprised at the people complaining about the service , because we found the service to be fine . especially given how busy and cramped it was . there were no tables , but they got us seats at the bar . the music was maybe a little loud , but i enjoyed the 90s throwback that was happening . the place looks like a dive , it 's a total hole in the wall , with no signs to speak of , but i liked the weird atmosphere of weird , old `` ghetto blasters '' on the walls and pics of arnold in terminator . it 's random , just go with it ... but the food ... .oh the food ! we were told that the squash poutine was a must have , so i ordered that and the bulgogi cheese steak , while my friend ordered the poutine and the mackerel . the mackerel was served first . it arrived raw , on a platter and a torch was taken to it to sear the outside and that was it . my friend allowed me a bite and it was so fresh tasting , with a delicious marinade . next came by bulgogi sandwich . fresh , delicious bread and amazing bulgogi . was very pleased . finally the `` poutines '' arrived . i should say that it was not what we were expecting . i assumed it would be squash on top of fries . but in fact the squash was the fries . they were lightly fried and covered in a variety of sauce `` gravies '' and scallions and some other stuff that i could neither make out , nor even see clearly ( dim lighting ) . it does n't matter okay ... .this stuff was heaven ! both my friend and i took a bite and looked at each other ... and proclaimed our new favourite food . other people in our party got the wings , which looked amazing and they said they were and the loosey , which was also proclaimed as delicious . so basically there were no wrong moves . the drink menu was very adventurous ... more so than we were , because we did n't take the plunge , although it was fun sitting at the bar and watching the bartender creating them . and splitting the bill for my friend with two others ( her birthday ) , my two `` tapas '' and a generic alcoholic beverage came to just under $ 30 . the prices are extremely reasonable ... and honestly once you try this stuff ... i mean , i do n't want to give them any ideas , but i would have paid more for that fine , fine food . i will be back . need me some more of that poutine !
DOC132 our friends got the groupon for four people and took us along . i 'm very pleased we went ! having never had ethiopian food before , we were curious , but wary . the deal really helped us dive in . it included two appetizers , four main courses and two desserts . we started with two appetizers , one i was n't a huge fan of ( a `` salad '' with a strong vinegar taste and jalapenos , which i found too strong , although other people in my group really liked it ) . the other appetizer was similar to an indian samosa ( similar name too , but i ca n't remember exactly what it was called ) . they were stuff with lentils and had a flaky shell . they were delicious . but , their appetizers were only made for three people , so there were only three of them ! seems silly when you offer a four person deal . we each ordered a different main course and they brought them on one large platter , so we could all share . we ordered two vegetarian options , one of lentils and one of chickpeas and one of chicken and one of beef . basically , the meals are more sauces than anything and they are served with injera , which are sort of bland , cold , bread-like stuff , which comes rolled up . they 're nothing special , but they 're only used as a sort of utensil , because you use it to scoop up the food . the food was delicious ! i especially liked the chickpea dish . every one of us ended up liking a different dish the best ! worked out well . i personally found the beef dish very tough though . once we were stuff with the food , we ordered two desserts . we especially liked the cheesecake ( which is obviously not ethiopian ) . we asked if they had any ethiopian coffees and they said yes . they showed us the beans , as they were being roasted . then they came back out with a sort of stone earthenware kettle and some small cups . the coffee was so rich , it was almost like chocolate . they also served it with a large basket of popcorn , which was just perfectly prepared . it was such a nice after dinner snack ! i would totally come here just to order the coffee ! it would have been a very expensive dinner without the groupon , so i 'm not sure i would make this a regularly destination , but as i said , the coffee was fantastic and it 's a fun thing to try , especially with friends . make sure they 're good ones , that you do n't mind getting messy in front of !
DOC133 a little on the pricey end for baked goods , but the baked goods are good . also their coffee products are great . the set up is annoying ( order your desserts on one side and coffee and food on another side ) , but the service is good and overall they do a good job .
DOC134 my sister told me that origin was well known for their delicious brunches , so we made a trip there to see if this was the case . origin is pretty new in our area and is very large , but nicely decorated . my only comment would be the washrooms , which feature communal sinks , the kind you find in elementary schools , where you step on the thing at the bottom and water comes out all around . besides not being very effective to quickly wash hands , it 's also wasteful if you 're the only one there . strange concept . throw back , but not necessarily one wants to remember during their brunch . now onto the important part ... the food and service . service started out alright and then immediately got very slow . it took some time to get our drink orders and then took a long time to get our actual orders . i ordered their french toast , my sister ordered tostada and my husband skipped brunch and ordered a meal they offered of a burger , fries covered in some chorizo and sauce and a float . i also ordered a side of bacon ... and was told that they were out of bacon ... which meant any orders that would have come with bacon were out entirely , or would be served without bacon . i 'm sorry but a brunch restaurant without bacon ? even the waitress admitted it was ridiculous . we also shared a plate of buscuits with their preserves . these were delicious . apparently my meal was the one that took the longest . the others got their food and we still waited for five minutes before mine came out . who knew it would take so long to put a couple of pieces of bread on a plate and cover them with blueberry preserves ? my sister said her tostada was quite good . my french toast was nothing special . the toast was `` fancy '' , rounded pieces , on top of each other with whipped cream and blueberries in between . the `` maple '' which was supposed to be on the plate ( maple syrup i 'm guessing ) was barely present . tasted like something i could have created with some ease . my husband 's dish was the best by far . his burger was juicy and this fries were great . the float was a little silly ... this big , meaty burger and fries covered in more meat ... paired with a cream soda float in pink and white layers . ( not insulting , we just got a laugh ) . nothing was cheap and then we had to wait a long time again to get our bill and pay . this was all strange because the restaurant was not particularly busy . because the brunch itself did n't blow me away , food shortages and service , i 'm not sure if i would bother with brunch again . oliver and bonicini in the actual mall has a much better brunch . i might try this again for lunch or dinner though .
DOC135 the saga has finished ... .because i needed to end this bs and move on .  so first off , the store owner responded to my complaints ... by blaming me . apparently it is my fault they sent the wrong thing , because i sent an email and then followed it up with a phone call ... which confused them and made them think there were two orders or something . which makes zero sense , because two orders were not sent . and the person i was speaking with on the phone responded to the emails i sent with codes to try out ... .so i have a hard time believing that they were confused by what was going on and thought that the phone order and email order were different .  they also told me they blocked me on instagram because i was body shaming their models . i want to be very clear on this . i never once body shamed , or made any comments on instagram about their models . i asked why they were promoting clothing they do n't even have in stock on instagram ... apparently that equates to body shaming to them .  they also informed me that because they had to mail so many orders to me ( 3 ) , they were going to start to charge me for shipping . they seemed to forget that i had also been paying to ship items back to them and that i had specifically chosen times when they had free shipping promos taking place to place orders . it 's not that they were n't charging me for shipping ... it was that i was taking advantage of their own promos . apparently i ca n't use their promos anymore , because they have placed an arbitrary rules on how many times you can make a return now . at least for me .  they did not address the code not working .  i responded and expressed continued frustration at their lack of ownership over their mistakes and how poor their customer service continued to be .  then i did some research and sent another email . instead of returning the dress i would donate it to dress for success . i said this seemed like a better choice than continuing to mail clothing back and forth . my request to them was that they take the would be money they would spend on continuing to mail me clothing and take some ownership for their mistakes and channel it into something good . i asked that they take the remaining $ 9.98 credit i had and put it towards them making a small donation , either monetarily or a piece of clothing , also to the charity . i stated that their continued neglect for customer service and lack of ownership over repeated problems should be owned up to , but if they would n't do it for me , perhaps they would be willing to do so for someone in need . i said that would conclude our business and bring something good out of this ridiculousness .  a few hours later i received an email with a letter of thanks for a donation made to dress for success ... for the amount of $ 10 via the store ... .so my remainder amount i had paid for and big sis closet 's contribution of ... .two cents . their generosity is astounding . now , i do n't know that they have n't made their own donation and just not told me of course ... i 'll let you guys decide whether you want to give them the benefit of the doubt in that regard . but given that they have taken zero responsibility for the continued poor management and customer service , well ... i think you can guess what my thoughts are on the subject . no further correspondence was sent from the actual store .  but at any rate , i am donating the new dress to dress for success ( along with my $ 9.98 ) and i am officially done with this store for good . and i sincerely hope that people read this review and think twice about shopping here . the clothes are not good quality , but more than that ... i have never experienced such insanely bad management and customer service in my life . zero regard for their customers , zero regard for their own mistakes , zero regard for taking ownership of ... anything ! just excuse after excuse and then turning the blame around on their customers . these people do not deserve your business and quite frankly ... ladies you deserve better . better clothing ( i have now purchased 6 items and been dissatisfied with the quality of all of them ... loose threads , flimsy , cheap fabric , wrong stitching for the fabric , no lining , incorrect fit for size , etc . ) and a greater degree of respect as a consumer .
DOC136 went here with my sister and her boyfriend for some drinks . we were hungry and ordered a few appetizers to share . drinks were fine ( my mix drink was on the very small side ) , but the food was really good . the perogies and `` chips '' and dip were excellent . the service was good and the atmosphere was nice , for such a small place . bathrooms were also nice , clean , etc . only problem is that some of the tables are so small , it 's really hard to use them . we were at a very small one and even though we fit around it alright , a guy walking by knocked a beer over with his coat and it dumped all down me . i mean all over me . it 's not the bar 's fault the guy knocked the glass , but if the table was a bit bigger we would have had more room to put the glass further in , so it would n't have gotten knocked in the first place . the fact is , if you 're going to serve food people need a place to put it . a few slightly bigger tables would go a long way .
DOC121 after being scared away from rock & rita 's , we ended up at this place , which was , if nothing else , quieter .  i 'll start by saying that the hostess and our server were both lovely and they 're really what earned the single star , because they were sweet , but the food was just horrible .  i ordered a simple grilled cheese sandwich . i asked the server if it was processed cheese , or `` real '' cheese in the sandwich and he had no idea what i was talking about . i tried to clarify by saying , `` is it like kraft single slices , or deli cheese ? '' he said it was `` good '' . this really should have been a sign and i could probably fault the waiter for this , since you should know what you 're serving , but he was so sweet , i could n't be mad !  my husband ordered a hot dog of sorts .  i asked if there was a way to substitute fries for a salad . there was not , but the server hooked me up and brought me a salad anyway ( no charge ) . i asked for sweet potato fries with the sandwich .  of course , my sandwich was made with plasticy , processed cheese , that was melted to the point of cheeze-wiz and was inedible . i took one bite of the sandwich and could n't do another . i got regular fries , instead of sweet potato ( did n't bother complaining , because i got the free salad , so whatever ... like i said , nice server ! ) my husband 's food was fine , although nothing special . they were good with the refills of our drinks .  anyway , as nice as the servers were , it was n't good . i would avoid eating here if i could .
DOC122 we got recommendations for this place from my parents and so , for our anniversary , we booked here . we were told though that it was first come , first served , in terms of having the ideal seats by the windows that overlook the fountains of the bellagio and the strip . we went for lunch though , so it was n't too busy . we were seated by the window and were promptly served some sort of puffed rolls , with cheese and herbs infused . they were delicious !  we ordered the onion soup to start and i ordered parmesan chicken and my husband ordered a lamb burger . our food came and was delicious . the soup was probably my favorite part . we were feeling very full by the end and so declined dessert , but were still given some jellies and chocolate truffle and then were served a small chocolate mousse , on a decorated plate that said happy anniversary , which was a total surprise ( they had asked when i booked if it was a special occasion , but had said nothing while we were there ) . overall the service was great , the food delicious and the view wonderful . it was a great experience !
DOC123 i went here for the first time yesterday night to celebrate something with my family . several members of my family have been to this place before for summerlicious and really enjoyed it .  a nice atmosphere and excellent service , everyone ordered a variety of different dishes , many of which i tasted . i myself had a chicken salad and thought it was very good . my sister 's pasta dish was amazing though ! our waiter never rushed us out and was quick to refill water and bread and clear dishes , etc . that with an arm brace on !  prices are a little high , which is why i did n't give this place five stars ... i know those amazing places exist out there with great food and great prices , but this was a nice evening out .
DOC124 worst experience ever ! i had been there before to get my nails done and the first time was quite good , but the second time was a hot mess . it looked like a five year old did my nails for me . i went home and took the polish off . but this is the kicker : i could n't get an appointment for highlights at my regular salon and this was close by , so i decided to give it a try ( obviously the nail girl would n't be doing my hair ) . i went in and sat down the a woman with an eastern european accent came to talk with me . i showed her a picture of what i wanted and she showed me various hair dye samples ... .none of which looked like my picture , but i always assume the hair dressers know what 's best . now , you 're all thinking , `` ..and she did a poor job and you hated the colour ... '' right ? nope , she told me she could n't do my hair because i had lice ! of course i freaked out . another hair dresser came over to see if i was alright and i was mortified . she asked if i had experienced any itching . i said no . this hairdresser turned back to the original hairdresser and asked if maybe it was n't too bad yet , but original hairdresser said it was really , really bad . i freaked out and left ( obviously without having anything done ) and went to a shoppers and bought lice shampoo . i went home and had my husband look at my hair . he looked and looked and could find nothing . i still did n't want to take chances , so we tore the house apart and washed and bagged everything and i went to a walk-in clinic . the doctor looked at my head and also said there was nothing there ! since i was paranoid , i still used the shampoo and anytime my head itched in the slightest i went to examine it . but even with my husband and mother looking at my head , we never found a single thing . we did n't even see dandruff ! ! i went to a hairdresser a week later and they told me my hair was beautiful ... but dry at the ends ... yeah , because of the chemical-filled lice shampoo ! thanks a lot you crazy woman ! so ultimately , i never had lice . i do n't know if this woman just decided she did n't feel like doing my hair , or if she was delusional , but i sure wo n't be going back there ever again . no one else should either , unless you want to risk being embarrassed and inconvenienced .
DOC125 i love cupcakes . seriously ... .love affair ! so i 'm always on the lookout for new cupcake places . i was in scarborough town centre and came upon this kiosk . it 's not a storefront , but a rather ingenious booth , with colourful signs and a glass showcase full of cupcakes .  there is a long list of flavours and i suspect ( as with many places ) they make different cupcakes for different days .  i ordered 6 , which was $ 18 ... i know , it 's steep , that 's pretty standard . cupcake places seem to range from around the $ 2.25 mark to around $ 4\/cupcake . so these guys fall somewhere inbetween . but not cheap , so i expect excellence , needless to say .  now , here 's the strange thing . on their website each cupcake is listed as $ 2.90 ... .was this the case at the store ? ? i sure hope not . why would you have to pay more for buying more ? maybe it 's an ordering online thing ? anyway , my guess is that you 're paying $ 3\/cupcake at the store , or $ 18 for 6 . no real incentive to buy 6 . but i did , so moving on ... .  of course i chose a range of flavours : oreo cookie . chocolate with vanilla icing , salted caramel , lemon and a double chocolate .  over two days we managed to work our way through them ( myself and my husband ) and i nibbled the different flavours . lemon was my favorite , by far , with the salted caramel being a huge disappointment . it was entirely too salty . more salt than caramel . it was n't very good at all .  but that said , none of the cupcakes really blew me away . and in fact , they were very stale the next day , despite being stored in an airtight container , in the fridge . luckily , the cold buttercream frosting was easy to scoop off and once they had been in the oven for a few minutes , they softened up a bit .  the bottoms of the cupcakes stuck to the wrappers and the flavours were dull tasting and uninspired .  i was also surprised at the lack of creativity in terms of christmas flavours or designed . right before christmas you would expect some special flavours ... maybe a candy cane , or gingerbread cupcake . it would be so easy to switch out one flavour and try to get people to consider your product for a christmas party dessert .  having a little kiosk in a mall is a smart idea . sadly , this business is not one i think i will bother with again !
DOC126 i had a craving for mexican and came here ( ie . yelp ) to figure out what we could do , because there is a very real lack of good mexican food in toronto . this place had some good reviews and was n't too far away from us , so off we went .  parking in leaside can be pretty brutal , but we finally found a space and luckily , street parking is free .  the restaurant is tacky , stereotypical , but cozy and we were quickly greeted and seated .  the menu has basic mexican fare , burritos , fajitas , tacos , with your choice of meat . nothing too outside of the box , but that 's not necessarily a bad thing .  we ordered the guacamole to start and i ordered a chicken enchilada and my husband ordered the chimichanga .  the guacamole is very delicious and creamy , but we had to ask for more nachos and even then it felt like not enough . we were really loading up the chips with the guacamole !  the food came out and the was served with rice , a salad ( sort of italian dressing with feta and tomatoes ) and refried beans . the salad was pretty generic and the rice was bland , but the actual main courses were great and the refried beans helped with the spice ( i 'm a wimp ) .  the appetizer and our main courses came to $ 30 and we were very full .  service was good and food was good and it was n't too expensive . it was n't perfect , but we 'll totally be back !
DOC127 came here with my mother , husband and baby for brunch\/lunch . we were all quite happy with our choice . i think i was the `` winner '' by ordering the french toast . it was practically half a loaf of bread , covered with fruit and with delicious cinnamon butter . my husband ordered the stoney 's breakfast , which is your basic eggs , toast , bacon , etc , meal . my mother ordered the omelet . huge portions , but at around $ 11- $ 13 per breakfast meal , it was on the steep end of brunches and other than mine , i 'm not sure the price is warranted , especially since it 's a order at the counter , then find a seat with your number and wait for your meal type place . people were friendly and service was good ( for what it was ) . i would give it a try if i was in the area again .
DOC128 never eaten at this place before , but it 's always crowded and i decided that must mean something . i was running errands and had n't eaten the whole day , so decided to finally give this place a shot . i ordered a chicken sandwich and iced tea .  the iced tea does n't appear to be iced tea . it was a dark reddish colour and tasted like very watered down pomegranate juice . it was inedible . it was super gross . i was thinking that maybe they made a mistake , but i ca n't see on the menu anything else it might be and the girl who took my order , poured the drink and gave it to me said it was iced tea . sooooo ew .  sandwich was alright , but just alright . the `` aroma sauce '' which is a garlic mayo of sorts was good and the roasted red peppers and mozzerella on the sandwich were good . the bread was good , but the chicken was the sort of cheap , crappy chicken you find at subway , where it 's a sort of compressed chicken-like white meat , with fake grill marks on it . it had no taste and really took away from the overall sandwich .  there are soups , salads and of course hot beverages served at this place as well , so i 'm not writing it off just yet , but this was not a good first impression .
DOC129 solid soup place ... has an ever-so-slightly sketchy vibe to it ... you order your soup and the woman disappears into the back ... usually closes the sliding window so you ca n't see back there and then eventually emerges with your soup . also seems to sell a selection of jamaican movies in dvd from a glass case ... sort of random .  generous with the veggies , less so with dumplings , but all the soups have great flavour and are decently sized for the price . i wish they would offer some bread or crackers for the soup ... would be a nice , easy add-on . but this place is what it is and does n't bother with the bells and whistles . really deserves a 3.5 stars . the red bean is my fav by far .
DOC130 i would be more inclined to give this place 3-1\/2 stars , but since that 's not possible , i 'm rounding down .  i went here for sunday lunch with a group for winterlicious . for $ 15 we got a choice of appetizer , entree and dessert .  we arrived first and our table was waiting for us . the restaurant was not busy at that point and our waiter was very attentive with water and the wine menu .  once our party finally arrived we all ordered . i had their chipotle sweet potato & goat cheese dip , which was average . the salads looked much better and got better reviews . same with the soup . the dip was literally a dollap of dip at the side of the plate with some crostinis on the other end and 1 piece of pickled cauliflower and a few slices of onion in the middle . the dip was good , the pickled cauliflower alright . it was nice when all combined on the crostini ( pickled veggies , dip on top of crostini ) .  i had originally wanted to order the double pork slider , but i saw it arrive at someone else 's table and it was literally just the one , single mini pork sandwich , with a few thinly cut fries at the side . it looked good , but it was appetizer size , if that . the chicken sandwich was more reasonably sized , so i ordered that . it was good . i really liked the bread . the macaroni was also more reasonably sized . i sampled it and it was fine . did n't blow me away .  dessert was the highlight of the meal for everyone i think . some people ordered the mousse , which i thought was fine , but the people who ordered it loved , so there you have it . my husband loved his apple terrine , which i tried and was good . i liked the flavour of my creme brule very much , but the top was over toasted and had hardened to the consistency of a thin , hard candy . it was hard to break with my spoon and got stuck in my teeth .  the service was consistently good , so no complaints there . none of us had wine with our lunch ( although some had other drinks ) , so i ca n't comment there .  this is a tapas bar , so i expect sizes to be small . but when sizes are small i expect them to be priced accordingly and\/or to be in sharable portions . they gave the prices of each dish if you were to purchased them individually . these would all be hard to share and would n't really be worth it . they are nice as a winterlicious meal , but i 'm not sure this would be my first choice to go back to .
DOC131 i am surprised at the people complaining about the service , because we found the service to be fine . especially given how busy and cramped it was . there were no tables , but they got us seats at the bar . the music was maybe a little loud , but i enjoyed the 90s throwback that was happening . the place looks like a dive , it 's a total hole in the wall , with no signs to speak of , but i liked the weird atmosphere of weird , old `` ghetto blasters '' on the walls and pics of arnold in terminator . it 's random , just go with it ... but the food ... .oh the food ! we were told that the squash poutine was a must have , so i ordered that and the bulgogi cheese steak , while my friend ordered the poutine and the mackerel . the mackerel was served first . it arrived raw , on a platter and a torch was taken to it to sear the outside and that was it . my friend allowed me a bite and it was so fresh tasting , with a delicious marinade . next came by bulgogi sandwich . fresh , delicious bread and amazing bulgogi . was very pleased . finally the `` poutines '' arrived . i should say that it was not what we were expecting . i assumed it would be squash on top of fries . but in fact the squash was the fries . they were lightly fried and covered in a variety of sauce `` gravies '' and scallions and some other stuff that i could neither make out , nor even see clearly ( dim lighting ) . it does n't matter okay ... .this stuff was heaven ! both my friend and i took a bite and looked at each other ... and proclaimed our new favourite food . other people in our party got the wings , which looked amazing and they said they were and the loosey , which was also proclaimed as delicious . so basically there were no wrong moves . the drink menu was very adventurous ... more so than we were , because we did n't take the plunge , although it was fun sitting at the bar and watching the bartender creating them . and splitting the bill for my friend with two others ( her birthday ) , my two `` tapas '' and a generic alcoholic beverage came to just under $ 30 . the prices are extremely reasonable ... and honestly once you try this stuff ... i mean , i do n't want to give them any ideas , but i would have paid more for that fine , fine food . i will be back . need me some more of that poutine !
DOC132 our friends got the groupon for four people and took us along . i 'm very pleased we went ! having never had ethiopian food before , we were curious , but wary . the deal really helped us dive in . it included two appetizers , four main courses and two desserts . we started with two appetizers , one i was n't a huge fan of ( a `` salad '' with a strong vinegar taste and jalapenos , which i found too strong , although other people in my group really liked it ) . the other appetizer was similar to an indian samosa ( similar name too , but i ca n't remember exactly what it was called ) . they were stuff with lentils and had a flaky shell . they were delicious . but , their appetizers were only made for three people , so there were only three of them ! seems silly when you offer a four person deal . we each ordered a different main course and they brought them on one large platter , so we could all share . we ordered two vegetarian options , one of lentils and one of chickpeas and one of chicken and one of beef . basically , the meals are more sauces than anything and they are served with injera , which are sort of bland , cold , bread-like stuff , which comes rolled up . they 're nothing special , but they 're only used as a sort of utensil , because you use it to scoop up the food . the food was delicious ! i especially liked the chickpea dish . every one of us ended up liking a different dish the best ! worked out well . i personally found the beef dish very tough though . once we were stuff with the food , we ordered two desserts . we especially liked the cheesecake ( which is obviously not ethiopian ) . we asked if they had any ethiopian coffees and they said yes . they showed us the beans , as they were being roasted . then they came back out with a sort of stone earthenware kettle and some small cups . the coffee was so rich , it was almost like chocolate . they also served it with a large basket of popcorn , which was just perfectly prepared . it was such a nice after dinner snack ! i would totally come here just to order the coffee ! it would have been a very expensive dinner without the groupon , so i 'm not sure i would make this a regularly destination , but as i said , the coffee was fantastic and it 's a fun thing to try , especially with friends . make sure they 're good ones , that you do n't mind getting messy in front of !
DOC133 a little on the pricey end for baked goods , but the baked goods are good . also their coffee products are great . the set up is annoying ( order your desserts on one side and coffee and food on another side ) , but the service is good and overall they do a good job .

'' he said it was `` good '' . this really should have been a sign and i could probably fault the waiter for this , since you should know what you 're serving , but he was so sweet , i could n't be mad !  my husband ordered a hot dog of sorts .  i asked if there was a way to substitute fries for a salad . there was not , but the server hooked me up and brought me a salad anyway ( no charge ) . i asked for sweet potato fries with the sandwich .  of course , my sandwich was made with plasticy , processed cheese , that was melted to the point of cheeze-wiz and was inedible . i took one bite of the sandwich and could n't do another . i got regular fries , instead of sweet potato ( did n't bother complaining , because i got the free salad , so whatever ... like i said , nice server ! ) my husband 's food was fine , although nothing special . they were good with the refills of our drinks .  anyway , as nice as the servers were , it was n't good . i would avoid eating here if i could .
DOC122 we got recommendations for this place from my parents and so , for our anniversary , we booked here . we were told though that it was first come , first served , in terms of having the ideal seats by the windows that overlook the fountains of the bellagio and the strip . we went for lunch though , so it was n't too busy . we were seated by the window and were promptly served some sort of puffed rolls , with cheese and herbs infused . they were delicious !  we ordered the onion soup to start and i ordered parmesan chicken and my husband ordered a lamb burger . our food came and was delicious . the soup was probably my favorite part . we were feeling very full by the end and so declined dessert , but were still given some jellies and chocolate truffle and then were served a small chocolate mousse , on a decorated plate that said happy anniversary , which was a total surprise ( they had asked when i booked if it was a special occasion , but had said nothing while we were there ) . overall the service was great , the food delicious and the view wonderful . it was a great experience !
DOC123 i went here for the first time yesterday night to celebrate something with my family . several members of my family have been to this place before for summerlicious and really enjoyed it .  a nice atmosphere and excellent service , everyone ordered a variety of different dishes , many of which i tasted . i myself had a chicken salad and thought it was very good . my sister 's pasta dish was amazing though ! our waiter never rushed us out and was quick to refill water and bread and clear dishes , etc . that with an arm brace on !  prices are a little high , which is why i did n't give this place five stars ... i know those amazing places exist out there with great food and great prices , but this was a nice evening out .
DOC124 worst experience ever ! i had been there before to get my nails done and the first time was quite good , but the second time was a hot mess . it looked like a five year old did my nails for me . i went home and took the polish off . but this is the kicker : i could n't get an appointment for highlights at my regular salon and this was close by , so i decided to give it a try ( obviously the nail girl would n't be doing my hair ) . i went in and sat down the a woman with an eastern european accent came to talk with me . i showed her a picture of what i wanted and she showed me various hair dye samples ... .none of which looked like my picture , but i always assume the hair dressers know what 's best . now , you 're all thinking , `` ..and she did a poor job and you hated the colour ... '' right ? nope , she told me she could n't do my hair because i had lice ! of course i freaked out . another hair dresser came over to see if i was alright and i was mortified . she asked if i had experienced any itching . i said no . this hairdresser turned back to the original hairdresser and asked if maybe it was n't too bad yet , but original hairdresser said it was really , really bad . i freaked out and left ( obviously without having anything done ) and went to a shoppers and bought lice shampoo . i went home and had my husband look at my hair . he looked and looked and could find nothing . i still did n't want to take chances , so we tore the house apart and washed and bagged everything and i went to a walk-in clinic . the doctor looked at my head and also said there was nothing there ! since i was paranoid , i still used the shampoo and anytime my head itched in the slightest i went to examine it . but even with my husband and mother looking at my head , we never found a single thing . we did n't even see dandruff ! ! i went to a hairdresser a week later and they told me my hair was beautiful ... but dry at the ends ... yeah , because of the chemical-filled lice shampoo ! thanks a lot you crazy woman ! so ultimately , i never had lice . i do n't know if this woman just decided she did n't feel like doing my hair , or if she was delusional , but i sure wo n't be going back there ever again . no one else should either , unless you want to risk being embarrassed and inconvenienced .
DOC125 i love cupcakes . seriously ... .love affair ! so i 'm always on the lookout for new cupcake places . i was in scarborough town centre and came upon this kiosk . it 's not a storefront , but a rather ingenious booth , with colourful signs and a glass showcase full of cupcakes .  there is a long list of flavours and i suspect ( as with many places ) they make different cupcakes for different days .  i ordered 6 , which was $ 18 ... i know , it 's steep , that 's pretty standard . cupcake places seem to range from around the $ 2.25 mark to around $ 4\/cupcake . so these guys fall somewhere inbetween . but not cheap , so i expect excellence , needless to say .  now , here 's the strange thing . on their website each cupcake is listed as $ 2.90 ... .was this the case at the store ? ? i sure hope not . why would you have to pay more for buying more ? maybe it 's an ordering online thing ? anyway , my guess is that you 're paying $ 3\/cupcake at the store , or $ 18 for 6 . no real incentive to buy 6 . but i did , so moving on ... .  of course i chose a range of flavours : oreo cookie . chocolate with vanilla icing , salted caramel , lemon and a double chocolate .  over two days we managed to work our way through them ( myself and my husband ) and i nibbled the different flavours . lemon was my favorite , by far , with the salted caramel being a huge disappointment . it was entirely too salty . more salt than caramel . it was n't very good at all .  but that said , none of the cupcakes really blew me away . and in fact , they were very stale the next day , despite being stored in an airtight container , in the fridge . luckily , the cold buttercream frosting was easy to scoop off and once they had been in the oven for a few minutes , they softened up a bit .  the bottoms of the cupcakes stuck to the wrappers and the flavours were dull tasting and uninspired .  i was also surprised at the lack of creativity in terms of christmas flavours or designed . right before christmas you would expect some special flavours ... maybe a candy cane , or gingerbread cupcake . it would be so easy to switch out one flavour and try to get people to consider your product for a christmas party dessert .  having a little kiosk in a mall is a smart idea . sadly , this business is not one i think i will bother with again !
DOC126 i had a craving for mexican and came here ( ie . yelp ) to figure out what we could do , because there is a very real lack of good mexican food in toronto . this place had some good reviews and was n't too far away from us , so off we went .  parking in leaside can be pretty brutal , but we finally found a space and luckily , street parking is free .  the restaurant is tacky , stereotypical , but cozy and we were quickly greeted and seated .  the menu has basic mexican fare , burritos , fajitas , tacos , with your choice of meat . nothing too outside of the box , but that 's not necessarily a bad thing .  we ordered the guacamole to start and i ordered a chicken enchilada and my husband ordered the chimichanga .  the guacamole is very delicious and creamy , but we had to ask for more nachos and even then it felt like not enough . we were really loading up the chips with the guacamole !  the food came out and the was served with rice , a salad ( sort of italian dressing with feta and tomatoes ) and refried beans . the salad was pretty generic and the rice was bland , but the actual main courses were great and the refried beans helped with the spice ( i 'm a wimp ) .  the appetizer and our main courses came to $ 30 and we were very full .  service was good and food was good and it was n't too expensive . it was n't perfect , but we 'll totally be back !
DOC127 came here with my mother , husband and baby for brunch\/lunch . we were all quite happy with our choice . i think i was the `` winner '' by ordering the french toast . it was practically half a loaf of bread , covered with fruit and with delicious cinnamon butter . my husband ordered the stoney 's breakfast , which is your basic eggs , toast , bacon , etc , meal . my mother ordered the omelet . huge portions , but at around $ 11- $ 13 per breakfast meal , it was on the steep end of brunches and other than mine , i 'm not sure the price is warranted , especially since it 's a order at the counter , then find a seat with your number and wait for your meal type place . people were friendly and service was good ( for what it was ) . i would give it a try if i was in the area again .
DOC128 never eaten at this place before , but it 's always crowded and i decided that must mean something . i was running errands and had n't eaten the whole day , so decided to finally give this place a shot . i ordered a chicken sandwich and iced tea .  the iced tea does n't appear to be iced tea . it was a dark reddish colour and tasted like very watered down pomegranate juice . it was inedible . it was super gross . i was thinking that maybe they made a mistake , but i ca n't see on the menu anything else it might be and the girl who took my order , poured the drink and gave it to me said it was iced tea . sooooo ew .  sandwich was alright , but just alright . the `` aroma sauce '' which is a garlic mayo of sorts was good and the roasted red peppers and mozzerella on the sandwich were good . the bread was good , but the chicken was the sort of cheap , crappy chicken you find at subway , where it 's a sort of compressed chicken-like white meat , with fake grill marks on it . it had no taste and really took away from the overall sandwich .  there are soups , salads and of course hot beverages served at this place as well , so i 'm not writing it off just yet , but this was not a good first impression .
DOC129 solid soup place ... has an ever-so-slightly sketchy vibe to it ... you order your soup and the woman disappears into the back ... usually closes the sliding window so you ca n't see back there and then eventually emerges with your soup . also seems to sell a selection of jamaican movies in dvd from a glass case ... sort of random .  generous with the veggies , less so with dumplings , but all the soups have great flavour and are decently sized for the price . i wish they would offer some bread or crackers for the soup ... would be a nice , easy add-on . but this place is what it is and does n't bother with the bells and whistles . really deserves a 3.5 stars . the red bean is my fav by far .
DOC130 i would be more inclined to give this place 3-1\/2 stars , but since that 's not possible , i 'm rounding down .  i went here for sunday lunch with a group for winterlicious . for $ 15 we got a choice of appetizer , entree and dessert .  we arrived first and our table was waiting for us . the restaurant was not busy at that point and our waiter was very attentive with water and the wine menu .  once our party finally arrived we all ordered . i had their chipotle sweet potato & goat cheese dip , which was average . the salads looked much better and got better reviews . same with the soup . the dip was literally a dollap of dip at the side of the plate with some crostinis on the other end and 1 piece of pickled cauliflower and a few slices of onion in the middle . the dip was good , the pickled cauliflower alright . it was nice when all combined on the crostini ( pickled veggies , dip on top of crostini ) .  i had originally wanted to order the double pork slider , but i saw it arrive at someone else 's table and it was literally just the one , single mini pork sandwich , with a few thinly cut fries at the side . it looked good , but it was appetizer size , if that . the chicken sandwich was more reasonably sized , so i ordered that . it was good . i really liked the bread . the macaroni was also more reasonably sized . i sampled it and it was fine . did n't blow me away .  dessert was the highlight of the meal for everyone i think . some people ordered the mousse , which i thought was fine , but the people who ordered it loved , so there you have it . my husband loved his apple terrine , which i tried and was good . i liked the flavour of my creme brule very much , but the top was over toasted and had hardened to the consistency of a thin , hard candy . it was hard to break with my spoon and got stuck in my teeth .  the service was consistently good , so no complaints there . none of us had wine with our lunch ( although some had other drinks ) , so i ca n't comment there .  this is a tapas bar , so i expect sizes to be small . but when sizes are small i expect them to be priced accordingly and\/or to be in sharable portions . they gave the prices of each dish if you were to purchased them individually . these would all be hard to share and would n't really be worth it . they are nice as a winterlicious meal , but i 'm not sure this would be my first choice to go back to .

DOC131 i am surprised at the people complaining about the service , because we found the service to be fine . especially given how busy and cramped it was . there were no tables , but they got us seats at the bar . the music was maybe a little loud , but i enjoyed the 90s throwback that was happening . the place looks like a dive , it 's a total hole in the wall , with no signs to speak of , but i liked the weird atmosphere of weird , old `` ghetto blasters '' on the walls and pics of arnold in terminator . it 's random , just go with it ... but the food ... .oh the food ! we were told that the squash poutine was a must have , so i ordered that and the bulgogi cheese steak , while my friend ordered the poutine and the mackerel . the mackerel was served first . it arrived raw , on a platter and a torch was taken to it to sear the outside and that was it . my friend allowed me a bite and it was so fresh tasting , with a delicious marinade . next came by bulgogi sandwich . fresh , delicious bread and amazing bulgogi . was very pleased . finally the `` poutines '' arrived . i should say that it was not what we were expecting . i assumed it would be squash on top of fries . but in fact the squash was the fries . they were lightly fried and covered in a variety of sauce `` gravies '' and scallions and some other stuff that i could neither make out , nor even see clearly ( dim lighting ) . it does n't matter okay ... .this stuff was heaven ! both my friend and i took a bite and looked at each other ... and proclaimed our new favourite food . other people in our party got the wings , which looked amazing and they said they were and the loosey , which was also proclaimed as delicious . so basically there were no wrong moves . the drink menu was very adventurous ... more so than we were , because we did n't take the plunge , although it was fun sitting at the bar and watching the bartender creating them . and splitting the bill for my friend with two others ( her birthday ) , my two `` tapas '' and a generic alcoholic beverage came to just under $ 30 . the prices are extremely reasonable ... and honestly once you try this stuff ... i mean , i do n't want to give them any ideas , but i would have paid more for that fine , fine food . i will be back . need me some more of that poutine !
DOC132 our friends got the groupon for four people and took us along . i 'm very pleased we went ! having never had ethiopian food before , we were curious , but wary . the deal really helped us dive in . it included two appetizers , four main courses and two desserts . we started with two appetizers , one i was n't a huge fan of ( a `` salad '' with a strong vinegar taste and jalapenos , which i found too strong , although other people in my group really liked it ) . the other appetizer was similar to an indian samosa ( similar name too , but i ca n't remember exactly what it was called ) . they were stuff with lentils and had a flaky shell . they were delicious . but , their appetizers were only made for three people , so there were only three of them ! seems silly when you offer a four person deal . we each ordered a different main course and they brought them on one large platter , so we could all share . we ordered two vegetarian options , one of lentils and one of chickpeas and one of chicken and one of beef . basically , the meals are more sauces than anything and they are served with injera , which are sort of bland , cold , bread-like stuff , which comes rolled up . they 're nothing special , but they 're only used as a sort of utensil , because you use it to scoop up the food . the food was delicious ! i especially liked the chickpea dish . every one of us ended up liking a different dish the best ! worked out well . i personally found the beef dish very tough though . once we were stuff with the food , we ordered two desserts . we especially liked the cheesecake ( which is obviously not ethiopian ) . we asked if they had any ethiopian coffees and they said yes . they showed us the beans , as they were being roasted . then they came back out with a sort of stone earthenware kettle and some small cups . the coffee was so rich , it was almost like chocolate . they also served it with a large basket of popcorn , which was just perfectly prepared . it was such a nice after dinner snack ! i would totally come here just to order the coffee ! it would have been a very expensive dinner without the groupon , so i 'm not sure i would make this a regularly destination , but as i said , the coffee was fantastic and it 's a fun thing to try , especially with friends . make sure they 're good ones , that you do n't mind getting messy in front of !
DOC133 a little on the pricey end for baked goods , but the baked goods are good . also their coffee products are great . the set up is annoying ( order your desserts on one side and coffee and food on another side ) , but the service is good and overall they do a good job .
DOC134 my sister told me that origin was well known for their delicious brunches , so we made a trip there to see if this was the case . origin is pretty new in our area and is very large , but nicely decorated . my only comment would be the washrooms , which feature communal sinks , the kind you find in elementary schools , where you step on the thing at the bottom and water comes out all around . besides not being very effective to quickly wash hands , it 's also wasteful if you 're the only one there . strange concept . throw back , but not necessarily one wants to remember during their brunch . now onto the important part ... the food and service . service started out alright and then immediately got very slow . it took some time to get our drink orders and then took a long time to get our actual orders . i ordered their french toast , my sister ordered tostada and my husband skipped brunch and ordered a meal they offered of a burger , fries covered in some chorizo and sauce and a float . i also ordered a side of bacon ... and was told that they were out of bacon ... which meant any orders that would have come with bacon were out entirely , or would be served without bacon . i 'm sorry but a brunch restaurant without bacon ? even the waitress admitted it was ridiculous . we also shared a plate of buscuits with their preserves . these were delicious . apparently my meal was the one that took the longest . the others got their food and we still waited for five minutes before mine came out . who knew it would take so long to put a couple of pieces of bread on a plate and cover them with blueberry preserves ? my sister said her tostada was quite good . my french toast was nothing special . the toast was `` fancy '' , rounded pieces , on top of each other with whipped cream and blueberries in between . the `` maple '' which was supposed to be on the plate ( maple syrup i 'm guessing ) was barely present . tasted like something i could have created with some ease . my husband 's dish was the best by far . his burger was juicy and this fries were great . the float was a little silly ... this big , meaty burger and fries covered in more meat ... paired with a cream soda float in pink and white layers . ( not insulting , we just got a laugh ) . nothing was cheap and then we had to wait a long time again to get our bill and pay . this was all strange because the restaurant was not particularly busy . because the brunch itself did n't blow me away , food shortages and service , i 'm not sure if i would bother with brunch again . oliver and bonicini in the actual mall has a much better brunch . i might try this again for lunch or dinner though .
DOC135 the saga has finished ... .because i needed to end this bs and move on .  so first off , the store owner responded to my complaints ... by blaming me . apparently it is my fault they sent the wrong thing , because i sent an email and then followed it up with a phone call ... which confused them and made them think there were two orders or something . which makes zero sense , because two orders were not sent . and the person i was speaking with on the phone responded to the emails i sent with codes to try out ... .so i have a hard time believing that they were confused by what was going on and thought that the phone order and email order were different .  they also told me they blocked me on instagram because i was body shaming their models . i want to be very clear on this . i never once body shamed , or made any comments on instagram about their models . i asked why they were promoting clothing they do n't even have in stock on instagram ... apparently that equates to body shaming to them .  they also informed me that because they had to mail so many orders to me ( 3 ) , they were going to start to charge me for shipping . they seemed to forget that i had also been paying to ship items back to them and that i had specifically chosen times when they had free shipping promos taking place to place orders . it 's not that they were n't charging me for shipping ... it was that i was taking advantage of their own promos . apparently i ca n't use their promos anymore , because they have placed an arbitrary rules on how many times you can make a return now . at least for me .  they did not address the code not working .  i responded and expressed continued frustration at their lack of ownership over their mistakes and how poor their customer service continued to be .  then i did some research and sent another email . instead of returning the dress i would donate it to dress for success . i said this seemed like a better choice than continuing to mail clothing back and forth . my request to them was that they take the would be money they would spend on continuing to mail me clothing and take some ownership for their mistakes and channel it into something good . i asked that they take the remaining $ 9.98 credit i had and put it towards them making a small donation , either monetarily or a piece of clothing , also to the charity . i stated that their continued neglect for customer service and lack of ownership over repeated problems should be owned up to , but if they would n't do it for me , perhaps they would be willing to do so for someone in need . i said that would conclude our business and bring something good out of this ridiculousness .  a few hours later i received an email with a letter of thanks for a donation made to dress for success ... for the amount of $ 10 via the store ... .so my remainder amount i had paid for and big sis closet 's contribution of ... .two cents . their generosity is astounding . now , i do n't know that they have n't made their own donation and just not told me of course ... i 'll let you guys decide whether you want to give them the benefit of the doubt in that regard . but given that they have taken zero responsibility for the continued poor management and customer service , well ... i think you can guess what my thoughts are on the subject . no further correspondence was sent from the actual store .  but at any rate , i am donating the new dress to dress for success ( along with my $ 9.98 ) and i am officially done with this store for good . and i sincerely hope that people read this review and think twice about shopping here . the clothes are not good quality , but more than that ... i have never experienced such insanely bad management and customer service in my life . zero regard for their customers , zero regard for their own mistakes , zero regard for taking ownership of ... anything ! just excuse after excuse and then turning the blame around on their customers . these people do not deserve your business and quite frankly ... ladies you deserve better . better clothing ( i have now purchased 6 items and been dissatisfied with the quality of all of them ... loose threads , flimsy , cheap fabric , wrong stitching for the fabric , no lining , incorrect fit for size , etc . ) and a greater degree of respect as a consumer .
DOC136 went here with my sister and her boyfriend for some drinks . we were hungry and ordered a few appetizers to share . drinks were fine ( my mix drink was on the very small side ) , but the food was really good . the perogies and `` chips '' and dip were excellent . the service was good and the atmosphere was nice , for such a small place . bathrooms were also nice , clean , etc . only problem is that some of the tables are so small , it 's really hard to use them . we were at a very small one and even though we fit around it alright , a guy walking by knocked a beer over with his coat and it dumped all down me . i mean all over me . it 's not the bar 's fault the guy knocked the glass , but if the table was a bit bigger we would have had more room to put the glass further in , so it would n't have gotten knocked in the first place . the fact is , if you 're going to serve food people need a place to put it . a few slightly bigger tables would go a long way .
DOC121 after being scared away from rock & rita 's , we ended up at this place , which was , if nothing else , quieter .  i 'll start by saying that the hostess and our server were both lovely and they 're really what earned the single star , because they were sweet , but the food was just horrible .  i ordered a simple grilled cheese sandwich . i asked the server if it was processed cheese , or `` real '' cheese in the sandwich and he had no idea what i was talking about . i tried to clarify by saying , `` is it like kraft single slices , or deli cheese ? '' he said it was `` good '' . this really should have been a sign and i could probably fault the waiter for this , since you should know what you 're serving , but he was so sweet , i could n't be mad !  my husband ordered a hot dog of sorts .  i asked if there was a way to substitute fries for a salad . there was not , but the server hooked me up and brought me a salad anyway ( no charge ) . i asked for sweet potato fries with the sandwich .  of course , my sandwich was made with plasticy , processed cheese , that was melted to the point of cheeze-wiz and was inedible . i took one bite of the sandwich and could n't do another . i got regular fries , instead of sweet potato ( did n't bother complaining , because i got the free salad , so whatever ... like i said , nice server ! ) my husband 's food was fine , although nothing special . they were good with the refills of our drinks .  anyway , as nice as the servers were , it was n't good . i would avoid eating here if i could .
DOC122 we got recommendations for this place from my parents and so , for our anniversary , we booked here . we were told though that it was first come , first served , in terms of having the ideal seats by the windows that overlook the fountains of the bellagio and the strip . we went for lunch though , so it was n't too busy . we were seated by the window and were promptly served some sort of puffed rolls , with cheese and herbs infused . they were delicious !  we ordered the onion soup to start and i ordered parmesan chicken and my husband ordered a lamb burger . our food came and was delicious . the soup was probably my favorite part . we were feeling very full by the end and so declined dessert , but were still given some jellies and chocolate truffle and then were served a small chocolate mousse , on a decorated plate that said happy anniversary , which was a total surprise ( they had asked when i booked if it was a special occasion , but had said nothing while we were there ) . overall the service was great , the food delicious and the view wonderful . it was a great experience !
DOC123 i went here for the first time yesterday night to celebrate something with my family . several members of my family have been to this place before for summerlicious and really enjoyed it .  a nice atmosphere and excellent service , everyone ordered a variety of different dishes , many of which i tasted . i myself had a chicken salad and thought it was very good . my sister 's pasta dish was amazing though ! our waiter never rushed us out and was quick to refill water and bread and clear dishes , etc . that with an arm brace on !  prices are a little high , which is why i did n't give this place five stars ... i know those amazing places exist out there with great food and great prices , but this was a nice evening out .
DOC124 worst experience ever ! i had been there before to get my nails done and the first time was quite good , but the second time was a hot mess . it looked like a five year old did my nails for me . i went home and took the polish off . but this is the kicker : i could n't get an appointment for highlights at my regular salon and this was close by , so i decided to give it a try ( obviously the nail girl would n't be doing my hair ) . i went in and sat down the a woman with an eastern european accent came to talk with me . i showed her a picture of what i wanted and she showed me various hair dye samples ... .none of which looked like my picture , but i always assume the hair dressers know what 's best . now , you 're all thinking , `` ..and she did a poor job and you hated the colour ... '' right ? nope , she told me she could n't do my hair because i had lice ! of course i freaked out . another hair dresser came over to see if i was alright and i was mortified . she asked if i had experienced any itching . i said no . this hairdresser turned back to the original hairdresser and asked if maybe it was n't too bad yet , but original hairdresser said it was really , really bad . i freaked out and left ( obviously without having anything done ) and went to a shoppers and bought lice shampoo . i went home and had my husband look at my hair . he looked and looked and could find nothing . i still did n't want to take chances , so we tore the house apart and washed and bagged everything and i went to a walk-in clinic . the doctor looked at my head and also said there was nothing there ! since i was paranoid , i still used the shampoo and anytime my head itched in the slightest i went to examine it . but even with my husband and mother looking at my head , we never found a single thing . we did n't even see dandruff ! ! i went to a hairdresser a week later and they told me my hair was beautiful ... but dry at the ends ... yeah , because of the chemical-filled lice shampoo ! thanks a lot you crazy woman ! so ultimately , i never had lice . i do n't know if this woman just decided she did n't feel like doing my hair , or if she was delusional , but i sure wo n't be going back there ever again . no one else should either , unless you want to risk being embarrassed and inconvenienced .
DOC125 i love cupcakes . seriously ... .love affair ! so i 'm always on the lookout for new cupcake places . i was in scarborough town centre and came upon this kiosk . it 's not a storefront , but a rather ingenious booth , with colourful signs and a glass showcase full of cupcakes .  there is a long list of flavours and i suspect ( as with many places ) they make different cupcakes for different days .  i ordered 6 , which was $ 18 ... i know , it 's steep , that 's pretty standard . cupcake places seem to range from around the $ 2.25 mark to around $ 4\/cupcake . so these guys fall somewhere inbetween . but not cheap , so i expect excellence , needless to say .  now , here 's the strange thing . on their website each cupcake is listed as $ 2.90 ... .was this the case at the store ? ? i sure hope not . why would you have to pay more for buying more ? maybe it 's an ordering online thing ? anyway , my guess is that you 're paying $ 3\/cupcake at the store , or $ 18 for 6 . no real incentive to buy 6 . but i did , so moving on ... .  of course i chose a range of flavours : oreo cookie . chocolate with vanilla icing , salted caramel , lemon and a double chocolate .  over two days we managed to work our way through them ( myself and my husband ) and i nibbled the different flavours . lemon was my favorite , by far , with the salted caramel being a huge disappointment . it was entirely too salty . more salt than caramel . it was n't very good at all .  but that said , none of the cupcakes really blew me away . and in fact , they were very stale the next day , despite being stored in an airtight container , in the fridge . luckily , the cold buttercream frosting was easy to scoop off and once they had been in the oven for a few minutes , they softened up a bit .  the bottoms of the cupcakes stuck to the wrappers and the flavours were dull tasting and uninspired .  i was also surprised at the lack of creativity in terms of christmas flavours or designed . right before christmas you would expect some special flavours ... maybe a candy cane , or gingerbread cupcake . it would be so easy to switch out one flavour and try to get people to consider your product for a christmas party dessert .  having a little kiosk in a mall is a smart idea . sadly , this business is not one i think i will bother with again !
DOC126 i had a craving for mexican and came here ( ie . yelp ) to figure out what we could do , because there is a very real lack of good mexican food in toronto . this place had some good reviews and was n't too far away from us , so off we went .  parking in leaside can be pretty brutal , but we finally found a space and luckily , street parking is free .  the restaurant is tacky , stereotypical , but cozy and we were quickly greeted and seated .  the menu has basic mexican fare , burritos , fajitas , tacos , with your choice of meat . nothing too outside of the box , but that 's not necessarily a bad thing .  we ordered the guacamole to start and i ordered a chicken enchilada and my husband ordered the chimichanga .  the guacamole is very delicious and creamy , but we had to ask for more nachos and even then it felt like not enough . we were really loading up the chips with the guacamole !  the food came out and the was served with rice , a salad ( sort of italian dressing with feta and tomatoes ) and refried beans . the salad was pretty generic and the rice was bland , but the actual main courses were great and the refried beans helped with the spice ( i 'm a wimp ) .  the appetizer and our main courses came to $ 30 and we were very full .  service was good and food was good and it was n't too expensive . it was n't perfect , but we 'll totally be back !
DOC127 came here with my mother , husband and baby for brunch\/lunch . we were all quite happy with our choice . i think i was the `` winner '' by ordering the french toast . it was practically half a loaf of bread , covered with fruit and with delicious cinnamon butter . my husband ordered the stoney 's breakfast , which is your basic eggs , toast , bacon , etc , meal . my mother ordered the omelet . huge portions , but at around $ 11- $ 13 per breakfast meal , it was on the steep end of brunches and other than mine , i 'm not sure the price is warranted , especially since it 's a order at the counter , then find a seat with your number and wait for your meal type place . people were friendly and service was good ( for what it was ) . i would give it a try if i was in the area again .
DOC128 never eaten at this place before , but it 's always crowded and i decided that must mean something . i was running errands and had n't eaten the whole day , so decided to finally give this place a shot . i ordered a chicken sandwich and iced tea .  the iced tea does n't appear to be iced tea . it was a dark reddish colour and tasted like very watered down pomegranate juice . it was inedible . it was super gross . i was thinking that maybe they made a mistake , but i ca n't see on the menu anything else it might be and the girl who took my order , poured the drink and gave it to me said it was iced tea . sooooo ew .  sandwich was alright , but just alright . the `` aroma sauce '' which is a garlic mayo of sorts was good and the roasted red peppers and mozzerella on the sandwich were good . the bread was good , but the chicken was the sort of cheap , crappy chicken you find at subway , where it 's a sort of compressed chicken-like white meat , with fake grill marks on it . it had no taste and really took away from the overall sandwich .  there are soups , salads and of course hot beverages served at this place as well , so i 'm not writing it off just yet , but this was not a good first impression .
DOC129 solid soup place ... has an ever-so-slightly sketchy vibe to it ... you order your soup and the woman disappears into the back ... usually closes the sliding window so you ca n't see back there and then eventually emerges with your soup . also seems to sell a selection of jamaican movies in dvd from a glass case ... sort of random .  generous with the veggies , less so with dumplings , but all the soups have great flavour and are decently sized for the price . i wish they would offer some bread or crackers for the soup ... would be a nice , easy add-on . but this place is what it is and does n't bother with the bells and whistles . really deserves a 3.5 stars . the red bean is my fav by far .
DOC130 i would be more inclined to give this place 3-1\/2 stars , but since that 's not possible , i 'm rounding down .  i went here for sunday lunch with a group for winterlicious . for $ 15 we got a choice of appetizer , entree and dessert .  we arrived first and our table was waiting for us . the restaurant was not busy at that point and our waiter was very attentive with water and the wine menu .  once our party finally arrived we all ordered . i had their chipotle sweet potato & goat cheese dip , which was average . the salads looked much better and got better reviews . same with the soup . the dip was literally a dollap of dip at the side of the plate with some crostinis on the other end and 1 piece of pickled cauliflower and a few slices of onion in the middle . the dip was good , the pickled cauliflower alright . it was nice when all combined on the crostini ( pickled veggies , dip on top of crostini ) .  i had originally wanted to order the double pork slider , but i saw it arrive at someone else 's table and it was literally just the one , single mini pork sandwich , with a few thinly cut fries at the side . it looked good , but it was appetizer size , if that . the chicken sandwich was more reasonably sized , so i ordered that . it was good . i really liked the bread . the macaroni was also more reasonably sized . i sampled it and it was fine . did n't blow me away .  dessert was the highlight of the meal for everyone i think . some people ordered the mousse , which i thought was fine , but the people who ordered it loved , so there you have it . my husband loved his apple terrine , which i tried and was good . i liked the flavour of my creme brule very much , but the top was over toasted and had hardened to the consistency of a thin , hard candy . it was hard to break with my spoon and got stuck in my teeth .  the service was consistently good , so no complaints there . none of us had wine with our lunch ( although some had other drinks ) , so i ca n't comment there .  this is a tapas bar , so i expect sizes to be small . but when sizes are small i expect them to be priced accordingly and\/or to be in sharable portions . they gave the prices of each dish if you were to purchased them individually . these would all be hard to share and would n't really be worth it . they are nice as a winterlicious meal , but i 'm not sure this would be my first choice to go back to .
DOC131 i am surprised at the people complaining about the service , because we found the service to be fine . especially given how busy and cramped it was . there were no tables , but they got us seats at the bar . the music was maybe a little loud , but i enjoyed the 90s throwback that was happening . the place looks like a dive , it 's a total hole in the wall , with no signs to speak of , but i liked the weird atmosphere of weird , old `` ghetto blasters '' on the walls and pics of arnold in terminator . it 's random , just go with it ... but the food ... .oh the food ! we were told that the squash poutine was a must have , so i ordered that and the bulgogi cheese steak , while my friend ordered the poutine and the mackerel . the mackerel was served first . it arrived raw , on a platter and a torch was taken to it to sear the outside and that was it . my friend allowed me a bite and it was so fresh tasting , with a delicious marinade . next came by bulgogi sandwich . fresh , delicious bread and amazing bulgogi . was very pleased . finally the `` poutines '' arrived . i should say that it was not what we were expecting . i assumed it would be squash on top of fries . but in fact the squash was the fries . they were lightly fried and covered in a variety of sauce `` gravies '' and scallions and some other stuff that i could neither make out , nor even see clearly ( dim lighting ) . it does n't matter okay ... .this stuff was heaven ! both my friend and i took a bite and looked at each other ... and proclaimed our new favourite food . other people in our party got the wings , which looked amazing and they said they were and the loosey , which was also proclaimed as delicious . so basically there were no wrong moves . the drink menu was very adventurous ... more so than we were , because we did n't take the plunge , although it was fun sitting at the bar and watching the bartender creating them . and splitting the bill for my friend with two others ( her birthday ) , my two `` tapas '' and a generic alcoholic beverage came to just under $ 30 . the prices are extremely reasonable ... and honestly once you try this stuff ... i mean , i do n't want to give them any ideas , but i would have paid more for that fine , fine food . i will be back . need me some more of that poutine !

DOC135 the saga has finished ... .because i needed to end this bs and move on .  so first off , the store owner responded to my complaints ... by blaming me . apparently it is my fault they sent the wrong thing , because i sent an email and then followed it up with a phone call ... which confused them and made them think there were two orders or something . which makes zero sense , because two orders were not sent . and the person i was speaking with on the phone responded to the emails i sent with codes to try out ... .so i have a hard time believing that they were confused by what was going on and thought that the phone order and email order were different .  they also told me they blocked me on instagram because i was body shaming their models . i want to be very clear on this . i never once body shamed , or made any comments on instagram about their models . i asked why they were promoting clothing they do n't even have in stock on instagram ... apparently that equates to body shaming to them .  they also informed me that because they had to mail so many orders to me ( 3 ) , they were going to start to charge me for shipping . they seemed to forget that i had also been paying to ship items back to them and that i had specifically chosen times when they had free shipping promos taking place to place orders . it 's not that they were n't charging me for shipping ... it was that i was taking advantage of their own promos . apparently i ca n't use their promos anymore , because they have placed an arbitrary rules on how many times you can make a return now . at least for me .  they did not address the code not working .  i responded and expressed continued frustration at their lack of ownership over their mistakes and how poor their customer service continued to be .  then i did some research and sent another email . instead of returning the dress i would donate it to dress for success . i said this seemed like a better choice than continuing to mail clothing back and forth . my request to them was that they take the would be money they would spend on continuing to mail me clothing and take some ownership for their mistakes and channel it into something good . i asked that they take the remaining $ 9.98 credit i had and put it towards them making a small donation , either monetarily or a piece of clothing , also to the charity . i stated that their continued neglect for customer service and lack of ownership over repeated problems should be owned up to , but if they would n't do it for me , perhaps they would be willing to do so for someone in need . i said that would conclude our business and bring something good out of this ridiculousness .  a few hours later i received an email with a letter of thanks for a donation made to dress for success ... for the amount of $ 10 via the store ... .so my remainder amount i had paid for and big sis closet 's contribution of ... .two cents . their generosity is astounding . now , i do n't know that they have n't made their own donation and just not told me of course ... i 'll let you guys decide whether you want to give them the benefit of the doubt in that regard . but given that they have taken zero responsibility for the continued poor management and customer service , well ... i think you can guess what my thoughts are on the subject . no further correspondence was sent from the actual store .  but at any rate , i am donating the new dress to dress for success ( along with my $ 9.98 ) and i am officially done with this store for good . and i sincerely hope that people read this review and think twice about shopping here . the clothes are not good quality , but more than that ... i have never experienced such insanely bad management and customer service in my life . zero regard for their customers , zero regard for their own mistakes , zero regard for taking ownership of ... anything ! just excuse after excuse and then turning the blame around on their customers . these people do not deserve your business and quite frankly ... ladies you deserve better . better clothing ( i have now purchased 6 items and been dissatisfied with the quality of all of them ... loose threads , flimsy , cheap fabric , wrong stitching for the fabric , no lining , incorrect fit for size , etc . ) and a greater degree of respect as a consumer .
DOC136 went here with my sister and her boyfriend for some drinks . we were hungry and ordered a few appetizers to share . drinks were fine ( my mix drink was on the very small side ) , but the food was really good . the perogies and `` chips '' and dip were excellent . the service was good and the atmosphere was nice , for such a small place . bathrooms were also nice , clean , etc . only problem is that some of the tables are so small , it 's really hard to use them . we were at a very small one and even though we fit around it alright , a guy walking by knocked a beer over with his coat and it dumped all down me . i mean all over me . it 's not the bar 's fault the guy knocked the glass , but if the table was a bit bigger we would have had more room to put the glass further in , so it would n't have gotten knocked in the first place . the fact is , if you 're going to serve food people need a place to put it . a few slightly bigger tables would go a long way .
DOC121 after being scared away from rock & rita 's , we ended up at this place , which was , if nothing else , quieter .  i 'll start by saying that the hostess and our server were both lovely and they 're really what earned the single star , because they were sweet , but the food was just horrible .  i ordered a simple grilled cheese sandwich . i asked the server if it was processed cheese , or `` real '' cheese in the sandwich and he had no idea what i was talking about . i tried to clarify by saying , `` is it like kraft single slices , or deli cheese ? '' he said it was `` good '' . this really should have been a sign and i could probably fault the waiter for this , since you should know what you 're serving , but he was so sweet , i could n't be mad !  my husband ordered a hot dog of sorts .  i asked if there was a way to substitute fries for a salad . there was not , but the server hooked me up and brought me a salad anyway ( no charge ) . i asked for sweet potato fries with the sandwich .  of course , my sandwich was made with plasticy , processed cheese , that was melted to the point of cheeze-wiz and was inedible . i took one bite of the sandwich and could n't do another . i got regular fries , instead of sweet potato ( did n't bother complaining , because i got the free salad , so whatever ... like i said , nice server ! ) my husband 's food was fine , although nothing special . they were good with the refills of our drinks .  anyway , as nice as the servers were , it was n't good . i would avoid eating here if i could .
DOC122 we got recommendations for this place from my parents and so , for our anniversary , we booked here . we were told though that it was first come , first served , in terms of having the ideal seats by the windows that overlook the fountains of the bellagio and the strip . we went for lunch though , so it was n't too busy . we were seated by the window and were promptly served some sort of puffed rolls , with cheese and herbs infused . they were delicious !  we ordered the onion soup to start and i ordered parmesan chicken and my husband ordered a lamb burger . our food came and was delicious . the soup was probably my favorite part . we were feeling very full by the end and so declined dessert , but were still given some jellies and chocolate truffle and then were served a small chocolate mousse , on a decorated plate that said happy anniversary , which was a total surprise ( they had asked when i booked if it was a special occasion , but had said nothing while we were there ) . overall the service was great , the food delicious and the view wonderful . it was a great experience !
DOC123 i went here for the first time yesterday night to celebrate something with my family . several members of my family have been to this place before for summerlicious and really enjoyed it .  a nice atmosphere and excellent service , everyone ordered a variety of different dishes , many of which i tasted . i myself had a chicken salad and thought it was very good . my sister 's pasta dish was amazing though ! our waiter never rushed us out and was quick to refill water and bread and clear dishes , etc . that with an arm brace on !  prices are a little high , which is why i did n't give this place five stars ... i know those amazing places exist out there with great food and great prices , but this was a nice evening out .
DOC124 worst experience ever ! i had been there before to get my nails done and the first time was quite good , but the second time was a hot mess . it looked like a five year old did my nails for me . i went home and took the polish off . but this is the kicker : i could n't get an appointment for highlights at my regular salon and this was close by , so i decided to give it a try ( obviously the nail girl would n't be doing my hair ) . i went in and sat down the a woman with an eastern european accent came to talk with me . i showed her a picture of what i wanted and she showed me various hair dye samples ... .none of which looked like my picture , but i always assume the hair dressers know what 's best . now , you 're all thinking , `` ..and she did a poor job and you hated the colour ... '' right ? nope , she told me she could n't do my hair because i had lice ! of course i freaked out . another hair dresser came over to see if i was alright and i was mortified . she asked if i had experienced any itching . i said no . this hairdresser turned back to the original hairdresser and asked if maybe it was n't too bad yet , but original hairdresser said it was really , really bad . i freaked out and left ( obviously without having anything done ) and went to a shoppers and bought lice shampoo . i went home and had my husband look at my hair . he looked and looked and could find nothing . i still did n't want to take chances , so we tore the house apart and washed and bagged everything and i went to a walk-in clinic . the doctor looked at my head and also said there was nothing there ! since i was paranoid , i still used the shampoo and anytime my head itched in the slightest i went to examine it . but even with my husband and mother looking at my head , we never found a single thing . we did n't even see dandruff ! ! i went to a hairdresser a week later and they told me my hair was beautiful ... but dry at the ends ... yeah , because of the chemical-filled lice shampoo ! thanks a lot you crazy woman ! so ultimately , i never had lice . i do n't know if this woman just decided she did n't feel like doing my hair , or if she was delusional , but i sure wo n't be going back there ever again . no one else should either , unless you want to risk being embarrassed and inconvenienced .
DOC125 i love cupcakes . seriously ... .love affair ! so i 'm always on the lookout for new cupcake places . i was in scarborough town centre and came upon this kiosk . it 's not a storefront , but a rather ingenious booth , with colourful signs and a glass showcase full of cupcakes .  there is a long list of flavours and i suspect ( as with many places ) they make different cupcakes for different days .  i ordered 6 , which was $ 18 ... i know , it 's steep , that 's pretty standard . cupcake places seem to range from around the $ 2.25 mark to around $ 4\/cupcake . so these guys fall somewhere inbetween . but not cheap , so i expect excellence , needless to say .  now , here 's the strange thing . on their website each cupcake is listed as $ 2.90 ... .was this the case at the store ? ? i sure hope not . why would you have to pay more for buying more ? maybe it 's an ordering online thing ? anyway , my guess is that you 're paying $ 3\/cupcake at the store , or $ 18 for 6 . no real incentive to buy 6 . but i did , so moving on ... .  of course i chose a range of flavours : oreo cookie . chocolate with vanilla icing , salted caramel , lemon and a double chocolate .  over two days we managed to work our way through them ( myself and my husband ) and i nibbled the different flavours . lemon was my favorite , by far , with the salted caramel being a huge disappointment . it was entirely too salty . more salt than caramel . it was n't very good at all .  but that said , none of the cupcakes really blew me away . and in fact , they were very stale the next day , despite being stored in an airtight container , in the fridge . luckily , the cold buttercream frosting was easy to scoop off and once they had been in the oven for a few minutes , they softened up a bit .  the bottoms of the cupcakes stuck to the wrappers and the flavours were dull tasting and uninspired .  i was also surprised at the lack of creativity in terms of christmas flavours or designed . right before christmas you would expect some special flavours ... maybe a candy cane , or gingerbread cupcake . it would be so easy to switch out one flavour and try to get people to consider your product for a christmas party dessert .  having a little kiosk in a mall is a smart idea . sadly , this business is not one i think i will bother with again !
DOC126 i had a craving for mexican and came here ( ie . yelp ) to figure out what we could do , because there is a very real lack of good mexican food in toronto . this place had some good reviews and was n't too far away from us , so off we went .  parking in leaside can be pretty brutal , but we finally found a space and luckily , street parking is free .  the restaurant is tacky , stereotypical , but cozy and we were quickly greeted and seated .  the menu has basic mexican fare , burritos , fajitas , tacos , with your choice of meat . nothing too outside of the box , but that 's not necessarily a bad thing .  we ordered the guacamole to start and i ordered a chicken enchilada and my husband ordered the chimichanga .  the guacamole is very delicious and creamy , but we had to ask for more nachos and even then it felt like not enough . we were really loading up the chips with the guacamole !  the food came out and the was served with rice , a salad ( sort of italian dressing with feta and tomatoes ) and refried beans . the salad was pretty generic and the rice was bland , but the actual main courses were great and the refried beans helped with the spice ( i 'm a wimp ) .  the appetizer and our main courses came to $ 30 and we were very full .  service was good and food was good and it was n't too expensive . it was n't perfect , but we 'll totally be back !
DOC127 came here with my mother , husband and baby for brunch\/lunch . we were all quite happy with our choice . i think i was the `` winner '' by ordering the french toast . it was practically half a loaf of bread , covered with fruit and with delicious cinnamon butter . my husband ordered the stoney 's breakfast , which is your basic eggs , toast , bacon , etc , meal . my mother ordered the omelet . huge portions , but at around $ 11- $ 13 per breakfast meal , it was on the steep end of brunches and other than mine , i 'm not sure the price is warranted , especially since it 's a order at the counter , then find a seat with your number and wait for your meal type place . people were friendly and service was good ( for what it was ) . i would give it a try if i was in the area again .
DOC128 never eaten at this place before , but it 's always crowded and i decided that must mean something . i was running errands and had n't eaten the whole day , so decided to finally give this place a shot . i ordered a chicken sandwich and iced tea .  the iced tea does n't appear to be iced tea . it was a dark reddish colour and tasted like very watered down pomegranate juice . it was inedible . it was super gross . i was thinking that maybe they made a mistake , but i ca n't see on the menu anything else it might be and the girl who took my order , poured the drink and gave it to me said it was iced tea . sooooo ew .  sandwich was alright , but just alright . the `` aroma sauce '' which is a garlic mayo of sorts was good and the roasted red peppers and mozzerella on the sandwich were good . the bread was good , but the chicken was the sort of cheap , crappy chicken you find at subway , where it 's a sort of compressed chicken-like white meat , with fake grill marks on it . it had no taste and really took away from the overall sandwich .  there are soups , salads and of course hot beverages served at this place as well , so i 'm not writing it off just yet , but this was not a good first impression .
DOC129 solid soup place ... has an ever-so-slightly sketchy vibe to it ... you order your soup and the woman disappears into the back ... usually closes the sliding window so you ca n't see back there and then eventually emerges with your soup . also seems to sell a selection of jamaican movies in dvd from a glass case ... sort of random .  generous with the veggies , less so with dumplings , but all the soups have great flavour and are decently sized for the price . i wish they would offer some bread or crackers for the soup ... would be a nice , easy add-on . but this place is what it is and does n't bother with the bells and whistles . really deserves a 3.5 stars . the red bean is my fav by far .
DOC130 i would be more inclined to give this place 3-1\/2 stars , but since that 's not possible , i 'm rounding down .  i went here for sunday lunch with a group for winterlicious . for $ 15 we got a choice of appetizer , entree and dessert .  we arrived first and our table was waiting for us . the restaurant was not busy at that point and our waiter was very attentive with water and the wine menu .  once our party finally arrived we all ordered . i had their chipotle sweet potato & goat cheese dip , which was average . the salads looked much better and got better reviews . same with the soup . the dip was literally a dollap of dip at the side of the plate with some crostinis on the other end and 1 piece of pickled cauliflower and a few slices of onion in the middle . the dip was good , the pickled cauliflower alright . it was nice when all combined on the crostini ( pickled veggies , dip on top of crostini ) .  i had originally wanted to order the double pork slider , but i saw it arrive at someone else 's table and it was literally just the one , single mini pork sandwich , with a few thinly cut fries at the side . it looked good , but it was appetizer size , if that . the chicken sandwich was more reasonably sized , so i ordered that . it was good . i really liked the bread . the macaroni was also more reasonably sized . i sampled it and it was fine . did n't blow me away .  dessert was the highlight of the meal for everyone i think . some people ordered the mousse , which i thought was fine , but the people who ordered it loved , so there you have it . my husband loved his apple terrine , which i tried and was good . i liked the flavour of my creme brule very much , but the top was over toasted and had hardened to the consistency of a thin , hard candy . it was hard to break with my spoon and got stuck in my teeth .  the service was consistently good , so no complaints there . none of us had wine with our lunch ( although some had other drinks ) , so i ca n't comment there .  this is a tapas bar , so i expect sizes to be small . but when sizes are small i expect them to be priced accordingly and\/or to be in sharable portions . they gave the prices of each dish if you were to purchased them individually . these would all be hard to share and would n't really be worth it . they are nice as a winterlicious meal , but i 'm not sure this would be my first choice to go back to .

DOC132 our friends got the groupon for four people and took us along . i 'm very pleased we went ! having never had ethiopian food before , we were curious , but wary . the deal really helped us dive in . it included two appetizers , four main courses and two desserts . we started with two appetizers , one i was n't a huge fan of ( a `` salad '' with a strong vinegar taste and jalapenos , which i found too strong , although other people in my group really liked it ) . the other appetizer was similar to an indian samosa ( similar name too , but i ca n't remember exactly what it was called ) . they were stuff with lentils and had a flaky shell . they were delicious . but , their appetizers were only made for three people , so there were only three of them ! seems silly when you offer a four person deal . we each ordered a different main course and they brought them on one large platter , so we could all share . we ordered two vegetarian options , one of lentils and one of chickpeas and one of chicken and one of beef . basically , the meals are more sauces than anything and they are served with injera , which are sort of bland , cold , bread-like stuff , which comes rolled up . they 're nothing special , but they 're only used as a sort of utensil , because you use it to scoop up the food . the food was delicious ! i especially liked the chickpea dish . every one of us ended up liking a different dish the best ! worked out well . i personally found the beef dish very tough though . once we were stuff with the food , we ordered two desserts . we especially liked the cheesecake ( which is obviously not ethiopian ) . we asked if they had any ethiopian coffees and they said yes . they showed us the beans , as they were being roasted . then they came back out with a sort of stone earthenware kettle and some small cups . the coffee was so rich , it was almost like chocolate . they also served it with a large basket of popcorn , which was just perfectly prepared . it was such a nice after dinner snack ! i would totally come here just to order the coffee ! it would have been a very expensive dinner without the groupon , so i 'm not sure i would make this a regularly destination , but as i said , the coffee was fantastic and it 's a fun thing to try , especially with friends . make sure they 're good ones , that you do n't mind getting messy in front of !
DOC133 a little on the pricey end for baked goods , but the baked goods are good . also their coffee products are great . the set up is annoying ( order your desserts on one side and coffee and food on another side ) , but the service is good and overall they do a good job .
DOC134 my sister told me that origin was well known for their delicious brunches , so we made a trip there to see if this was the case . origin is pretty new in our area and is very large , but nicely decorated . my only comment would be the washrooms , which feature communal sinks , the kind you find in elementary schools , where you step on the thing at the bottom and water comes out all around . besides not being very effective to quickly wash hands , it 's also wasteful if you 're the only one there . strange concept . throw back , but not necessarily one wants to remember during their brunch . now onto the important part ... the food and service . service started out alright and then immediately got very slow . it took some time to get our drink orders and then took a long time to get our actual orders . i ordered their french toast , my sister ordered tostada and my husband skipped brunch and ordered a meal they offered of a burger , fries covered in some chorizo and sauce and a float . i also ordered a side of bacon ... and was told that they were out of bacon ... which meant any orders that would have come with bacon were out entirely , or would be served without bacon . i 'm sorry but a brunch restaurant without bacon ? even the waitress admitted it was ridiculous . we also shared a plate of buscuits with their preserves . these were delicious . apparently my meal was the one that took the longest . the others got their food and we still waited for five minutes before mine came out . who knew it would take so long to put a couple of pieces of bread on a plate and cover them with blueberry preserves ? my sister said her tostada was quite good . my french toast was nothing special . the toast was `` fancy '' , rounded pieces , on top of each other with whipped cream and blueberries in between . the `` maple '' which was supposed to be on the plate ( maple syrup i 'm guessing ) was barely present . tasted like something i could have created with some ease . my husband 's dish was the best by far . his burger was juicy and this fries were great . the float was a little silly ... this big , meaty burger and fries covered in more meat ... paired with a cream soda float in pink and white layers . ( not insulting , we just got a laugh ) . nothing was cheap and then we had to wait a long time again to get our bill and pay . this was all strange because the restaurant was not particularly busy . because the brunch itself did n't blow me away , food shortages and service , i 'm not sure if i would bother with brunch again . oliver and bonicini in the actual mall has a much better brunch . i might try this again for lunch or dinner though .
DOC135 the saga has finished ... .because i needed to end this bs and move on .  so first off , the store owner responded to my complaints ... by blaming me . apparently it is my fault they sent the wrong thing , because i sent an email and then followed it up with a phone call ... which confused them and made them think there were two orders or something . which makes zero sense , because two orders were not sent . and the person i was speaking with on the phone responded to the emails i sent with codes to try out ... .so i have a hard time believing that they were confused by what was going on and thought that the phone order and email order were different .  they also told me they blocked me on instagram because i was body shaming their models . i want to be very clear on this . i never once body shamed , or made any comments on instagram about their models . i asked why they were promoting clothing they do n't even have in stock on instagram ... apparently that equates to body shaming to them .  they also informed me that because they had to mail so many orders to me ( 3 ) , they were going to start to charge me for shipping . they seemed to forget that i had also been paying to ship items back to them and that i had specifically chosen times when they had free shipping promos taking place to place orders . it 's not that they were n't charging me for shipping ... it was that i was taking advantage of their own promos . apparently i ca n't use their promos anymore , because they have placed an arbitrary rules on how many times you can make a return now . at least for me .  they did not address the code not working .  i responded and expressed continued frustration at their lack of ownership over their mistakes and how poor their customer service continued to be .  then i did some research and sent another email . instead of returning the dress i would donate it to dress for success . i said this seemed like a better choice than continuing to mail clothing back and forth . my request to them was that they take the would be money they would spend on continuing to mail me clothing and take some ownership for their mistakes and channel it into something good . i asked that they take the remaining $ 9.98 credit i had and put it towards them making a small donation , either monetarily or a piece of clothing , also to the charity . i stated that their continued neglect for customer service and lack of ownership over repeated problems should be owned up to , but if they would n't do it for me , perhaps they would be willing to do so for someone in need . i said that would conclude our business and bring something good out of this ridiculousness .  a few hours later i received an email with a letter of thanks for a donation made to dress for success ... for the amount of $ 10 via the store ... .so my remainder amount i had paid for and big sis closet 's contribution of ... .two cents . their generosity is astounding . now , i do n't know that they have n't made their own donation and just not told me of course ... i 'll let you guys decide whether you want to give them the benefit of the doubt in that regard . but given that they have taken zero responsibility for the continued poor management and customer service , well ... i think you can guess what my thoughts are on the subject . no further correspondence was sent from the actual store .  but at any rate , i am donating the new dress to dress for success ( along with my $ 9.98 ) and i am officially done with this store for good . and i sincerely hope that people read this review and think twice about shopping here . the clothes are not good quality , but more than that ... i have never experienced such insanely bad management and customer service in my life . zero regard for their customers , zero regard for their own mistakes , zero regard for taking ownership of ... anything ! just excuse after excuse and then turning the blame around on their customers . these people do not deserve your business and quite frankly ... ladies you deserve better . better clothing ( i have now purchased 6 items and been dissatisfied with the quality of all of them ... loose threads , flimsy , cheap fabric , wrong stitching for the fabric , no lining , incorrect fit for size , etc . ) and a greater degree of respect as a consumer .
DOC136 went here with my sister and her boyfriend for some drinks . we were hungry and ordered a few appetizers to share . drinks were fine ( my mix drink was on the very small side ) , but the food was really good . the perogies and `` chips '' and dip were excellent . the service was good and the atmosphere was nice , for such a small place . bathrooms were also nice , clean , etc . only problem is that some of the tables are so small , it 's really hard to use them . we were at a very small one and even though we fit around it alright , a guy walking by knocked a beer over with his coat and it dumped all down me . i mean all over me . it 's not the bar 's fault the guy knocked the glass , but if the table was a bit bigger we would have had more room to put the glass further in , so it would n't have gotten knocked in the first place . the fact is , if you 're going to serve food people need a place to put it . a few slightly bigger tables would go a long way .
DOC121 after being scared away from rock & rita 's , we ended up at this place , which was , if nothing else , quieter .  i 'll start by saying that the hostess and our server were both lovely and they 're really what earned the single star , because they were sweet , but the food was just horrible .  i ordered a simple grilled cheese sandwich . i asked the server if it was processed cheese , or `` real '' cheese in the sandwich and he had no idea what i was talking about . i tried to clarify by saying , `` is it like kraft single slices , or deli cheese ? '' he said it was `` good '' . this really should have been a sign and i could probably fault the waiter for this , since you should know what you 're serving , but he was so sweet , i could n't be mad !  my husband ordered a hot dog of sorts .  i asked if there was a way to substitute fries for a salad . there was not , but the server hooked me up and brought me a salad anyway ( no charge ) . i asked for sweet potato fries with the sandwich .  of course , my sandwich was made with plasticy , processed cheese , that was melted to the point of cheeze-wiz and was inedible . i took one bite of the sandwich and could n't do another . i got regular fries , instead of sweet potato ( did n't bother complaining , because i got the free salad , so whatever ... like i said , nice server ! ) my husband 's food was fine , although nothing special . they were good with the refills of our drinks .  anyway , as nice as the servers were , it was n't good . i would avoid eating here if i could .
DOC122 we got recommendations for this place from my parents and so , for our anniversary , we booked here . we were told though that it was first come , first served , in terms of having the ideal seats by the windows that overlook the fountains of the bellagio and the strip . we went for lunch though , so it was n't too busy . we were seated by the window and were promptly served some sort of puffed rolls , with cheese and herbs infused . they were delicious !  we ordered the onion soup to start and i ordered parmesan chicken and my husband ordered a lamb burger . our food came and was delicious . the soup was probably my favorite part . we were feeling very full by the end and so declined dessert , but were still given some jellies and chocolate truffle and then were served a small chocolate mousse , on a decorated plate that said happy anniversary , which was a total surprise ( they had asked when i booked if it was a special occasion , but had said nothing while we were there ) . overall the service was great , the food delicious and the view wonderful . it was a great experience !
DOC123 i went here for the first time yesterday night to celebrate something with my family . several members of my family have been to this place before for summerlicious and really enjoyed it .  a nice atmosphere and excellent service , everyone ordered a variety of different dishes , many of which i tasted . i myself had a chicken salad and thought it was very good . my sister 's pasta dish was amazing though ! our waiter never rushed us out and was quick to refill water and bread and clear dishes , etc . that with an arm brace on !  prices are a little high , which is why i did n't give this place five stars ... i know those amazing places exist out there with great food and great prices , but this was a nice evening out .
DOC124 worst experience ever ! i had been there before to get my nails done and the first time was quite good , but the second time was a hot mess . it looked like a five year old did my nails for me . i went home and took the polish off . but this is the kicker : i could n't get an appointment for highlights at my regular salon and this was close by , so i decided to give it a try ( obviously the nail girl would n't be doing my hair ) . i went in and sat down the a woman with an eastern european accent came to talk with me . i showed her a picture of what i wanted and she showed me various hair dye samples ... .none of which looked like my picture , but i always assume the hair dressers know what 's best . now , you 're all thinking , `` ..and she did a poor job and you hated the colour ... '' right ? nope , she told me she could n't do my hair because i had lice ! of course i freaked out . another hair dresser came over to see if i was alright and i was mortified . she asked if i had experienced any itching . i said no . this hairdresser turned back to the original hairdresser and asked if maybe it was n't too bad yet , but original hairdresser said it was really , really bad . i freaked out and left ( obviously without having anything done ) and went to a shoppers and bought lice shampoo . i went home and had my husband look at my hair . he looked and looked and could find nothing . i still did n't want to take chances , so we tore the house apart and washed and bagged everything and i went to a walk-in clinic . the doctor looked at my head and also said there was nothing there ! since i was paranoid , i still used the shampoo and anytime my head itched in the slightest i went to examine it . but even with my husband and mother looking at my head , we never found a single thing . we did n't even see dandruff ! ! i went to a hairdresser a week later and they told me my hair was beautiful ... but dry at the ends ... yeah , because of the chemical-filled lice shampoo ! thanks a lot you crazy woman ! so ultimately , i never had lice . i do n't know if this woman just decided she did n't feel like doing my hair , or if she was delusional , but i sure wo n't be going back there ever again . no one else should either , unless you want to risk being embarrassed and inconvenienced .
DOC125 i love cupcakes . seriously ... .love affair ! so i 'm always on the lookout for new cupcake places . i was in scarborough town centre and came upon this kiosk . it 's not a storefront , but a rather ingenious booth , with colourful signs and a glass showcase full of cupcakes .  there is a long list of flavours and i suspect ( as with many places ) they make different cupcakes for different days .  i ordered 6 , which was $ 18 ... i know , it 's steep , that 's pretty standard . cupcake places seem to range from around the $ 2.25 mark to around $ 4\/cupcake . so these guys fall somewhere inbetween . but not cheap , so i expect excellence , needless to say .  now , here 's the strange thing . on their website each cupcake is listed as $ 2.90 ... .was this the case at the store ? ? i sure hope not . why would you have to pay more for buying more ? maybe it 's an ordering online thing ? anyway , my guess is that you 're paying $ 3\/cupcake at the store , or $ 18 for 6 . no real incentive to buy 6 . but i did , so moving on ... .  of course i chose a range of flavours : oreo cookie . chocolate with vanilla icing , salted caramel , lemon and a double chocolate .  over two days we managed to work our way through them ( myself and my husband ) and i nibbled the different flavours . lemon was my favorite , by far , with the salted caramel being a huge disappointment . it was entirely too salty . more salt than caramel . it was n't very good at all .  but that said , none of the cupcakes really blew me away . and in fact , they were very stale the next day , despite being stored in an airtight container , in the fridge . luckily , the cold buttercream frosting was easy to scoop off and once they had been in the oven for a few minutes , they softened up a bit .  the bottoms of the cupcakes stuck to the wrappers and the flavours were dull tasting and uninspired .  i was also surprised at the lack of creativity in terms of christmas flavours or designed . right before christmas you would expect some special flavours ... maybe a candy cane , or gingerbread cupcake . it would be so easy to switch out one flavour and try to get people to consider your product for a christmas party dessert .  having a little kiosk in a mall is a smart idea . sadly , this business is not one i think i will bother with again !
DOC126 i had a craving for mexican and came here ( ie . yelp ) to figure out what we could do , because there is a very real lack of good mexican food in toronto . this place had some good reviews and was n't too far away from us , so off we went .  parking in leaside can be pretty brutal , but we finally found a space and luckily , street parking is free .  the restaurant is tacky , stereotypical , but cozy and we were quickly greeted and seated .  the menu has basic mexican fare , burritos , fajitas , tacos , with your choice of meat . nothing too outside of the box , but that 's not necessarily a bad thing .  we ordered the guacamole to start and i ordered a chicken enchilada and my husband ordered the chimichanga .  the guacamole is very delicious and creamy , but we had to ask for more nachos and even then it felt like not enough . we were really loading up the chips with the guacamole !  the food came out and the was served with rice , a salad ( sort of italian dressing with feta and tomatoes ) and refried beans . the salad was pretty generic and the rice was bland , but the actual main courses were great and the refried beans helped with the spice ( i 'm a wimp ) .  the appetizer and our main courses came to $ 30 and we were very full .  service was good and food was good and it was n't too expensive . it was n't perfect , but we 'll totally be back !
DOC127 came here with my mother , husband and baby for brunch\/lunch . we were all quite happy with our choice . i think i was the `` winner '' by ordering the french toast . it was practically half a loaf of bread , covered with fruit and with delicious cinnamon butter . my husband ordered the stoney 's breakfast , which is your basic eggs , toast , bacon , etc , meal . my mother ordered the omelet . huge portions , but at around $ 11- $ 13 per breakfast meal , it was on the steep end of brunches and other than mine , i 'm not sure the price is warranted , especially since it 's a order at the counter , then find a seat with your number and wait for your meal type place . people were friendly and service was good ( for what it was ) . i would give it a try if i was in the area again .

DOC133 a little on the pricey end for baked goods , but the baked goods are good . also their coffee products are great . the set up is annoying ( order your desserts on one side and coffee and food on another side ) , but the service is good and overall they do a good job .
DOC134 my sister told me that origin was well known for their delicious brunches , so we made a trip there to see if this was the case . origin is pretty new in our area and is very large , but nicely decorated . my only comment would be the washrooms , which feature communal sinks , the kind you find in elementary schools , where you step on the thing at the bottom and water comes out all around . besides not being very effective to quickly wash hands , it 's also wasteful if you 're the only one there . strange concept . throw back , but not necessarily one wants to remember during their brunch . now onto the important part ... the food and service . service started out alright and then immediately got very slow . it took some time to get our drink orders and then took a long time to get our actual orders . i ordered their french toast , my sister ordered tostada and my husband skipped brunch and ordered a meal they offered of a burger , fries covered in some chorizo and sauce and a float . i also ordered a side of bacon ... and was told that they were out of bacon ... which meant any orders that would have come with bacon were out entirely , or would be served without bacon . i 'm sorry but a brunch restaurant without bacon ? even the waitress admitted it was ridiculous . we also shared a plate of buscuits with their preserves . these were delicious . apparently my meal was the one that took the longest . the others got their food and we still waited for five minutes before mine came out . who knew it would take so long to put a couple of pieces of bread on a plate and cover them with blueberry preserves ? my sister said her tostada was quite good . my french toast was nothing special . the toast was `` fancy '' , rounded pieces , on top of each other with whipped cream and blueberries in between . the `` maple '' which was supposed to be on the plate ( maple syrup i 'm guessing ) was barely present . tasted like something i could have created with some ease . my husband 's dish was the best by far . his burger was juicy and this fries were great . the float was a little silly ... this big , meaty burger and fries covered in more meat ... paired with a cream soda float in pink and white layers . ( not insulting , we just got a laugh ) . nothing was cheap and then we had to wait a long time again to get our bill and pay . this was all strange because the restaurant was not particularly busy . because the brunch itself did n't blow me away , food shortages and service , i 'm not sure if i would bother with brunch again . oliver and bonicini in the actual mall has a much better brunch . i might try this again for lunch or dinner though .
DOC135 the saga has finished ... .because i needed to end this bs and move on .  so first off , the store owner responded to my complaints ... by blaming me . apparently it is my fault they sent the wrong thing , because i sent an email and then followed it up with a phone call ... which confused them and made them think there were two orders or something . which makes zero sense , because two orders were not sent . and the person i was speaking with on the phone responded to the emails i sent with codes to try out ... .so i have a hard time believing that they were confused by what was going on and thought that the phone order and email order were different .  they also told me they blocked me on instagram because i was body shaming their models . i want to be very clear on this . i never once body shamed , or made any comments on instagram about their models . i asked why they were promoting clothing they do n't even have in stock on instagram ... apparently that equates to body shaming to them .  they also informed me that because they had to mail so many orders to me ( 3 ) , they were going to start to charge me for shipping . they seemed to forget that i had also been paying to ship items back to them and that i had specifically chosen times when they had free shipping promos taking place to place orders . it 's not that they were n't charging me for shipping ... it was that i was taking advantage of their own promos . apparently i ca n't use their promos anymore , because they have placed an arbitrary rules on how many times you can make a return now . at least for me .  they did not address the code not working .  i responded and expressed continued frustration at their lack of ownership over their mistakes and how poor their customer service continued to be .  then i did some research and sent another email . instead of returning the dress i would donate it to dress for success . i said this seemed like a better choice than continuing to mail clothing back and forth . my request to them was that they take the would be money they would spend on continuing to mail me clothing and take some ownership for their mistakes and channel it into something good . i asked that they take the remaining $ 9.98 credit i had and put it towards them making a small donation , either monetarily or a piece of clothing , also to the charity . i stated that their continued neglect for customer service and lack of ownership over repeated problems should be owned up to , but if they would n't do it for me , perhaps they would be willing to do so for someone in need . i said that would conclude our business and bring something good out of this ridiculousness .  a few hours later i received an email with a letter of thanks for a donation made to dress for success ... for the amount of $ 10 via the store ... .so my remainder amount i had paid for and big sis closet 's contribution of ... .two cents . their generosity is astounding . now , i do n't know that they have n't made their own donation and just not told me of course ... i 'll let you guys decide whether you want to give them the benefit of the doubt in that regard . but given that they have taken zero responsibility for the continued poor management and customer service , well ... i think you can guess what my thoughts are on the subject . no further correspondence was sent from the actual store .  but at any rate , i am donating the new dress to dress for success ( along with my $ 9.98 ) and i am officially done with this store for good . and i sincerely hope that people read this review and think twice about shopping here . the clothes are not good quality , but more than that ... i have never experienced such insanely bad management and customer service in my life . zero regard for their customers , zero regard for their own mistakes , zero regard for taking ownership of ... anything ! just excuse after excuse and then turning the blame around on their customers . these people do not deserve your business and quite frankly ... ladies you deserve better . better clothing ( i have now purchased 6 items and been dissatisfied with the quality of all of them ... loose threads , flimsy , cheap fabric , wrong stitching for the fabric , no lining , incorrect fit for size , etc . ) and a greater degree of respect as a consumer .
DOC136 went here with my sister and her boyfriend for some drinks . we were hungry and ordered a few appetizers to share . drinks were fine ( my mix drink was on the very small side ) , but the food was really good . the perogies and `` chips '' and dip were excellent . the service was good and the atmosphere was nice , for such a small place . bathrooms were also nice , clean , etc . only problem is that some of the tables are so small , it 's really hard to use them . we were at a very small one and even though we fit around it alright , a guy walking by knocked a beer over with his coat and it dumped all down me . i mean all over me . it 's not the bar 's fault the guy knocked the glass , but if the table was a bit bigger we would have had more room to put the glass further in , so it would n't have gotten knocked in the first place . the fact is , if you 're going to serve food people need a place to put it . a few slightly bigger tables would go a long way .
DOC121 after being scared away from rock & rita 's , we ended up at this place , which was , if nothing else , quieter .  i 'll start by saying that the hostess and our server were both lovely and they 're really what earned the single star , because they were sweet , but the food was just horrible .  i ordered a simple grilled cheese sandwich . i asked the server if it was processed cheese , or `` real '' cheese in the sandwich and he had no idea what i was talking about . i tried to clarify by saying , `` is it like kraft single slices , or deli cheese ? '' he said it was `` good '' . this really should have been a sign and i could probably fault the waiter for this , since you should know what you 're serving , but he was so sweet , i could n't be mad !  my husband ordered a hot dog of sorts .  i asked if there was a way to substitute fries for a salad . there was not , but the server hooked me up and brought me a salad anyway ( no charge ) . i asked for sweet potato fries with the sandwich .  of course , my sandwich was made with plasticy , processed cheese , that was melted to the point of cheeze-wiz and was inedible . i took one bite of the sandwich and could n't do another . i got regular fries , instead of sweet potato ( did n't bother complaining , because i got the free salad , so whatever ... like i said , nice server ! ) my husband 's food was fine , although nothing special . they were good with the refills of our drinks .  anyway , as nice as the servers were , it was n't good . i would avoid eating here if i could .
DOC122 we got recommendations for this place from my parents and so , for our anniversary , we booked here . we were told though that it was first come , first served , in terms of having the ideal seats by the windows that overlook the fountains of the bellagio and the strip . we went for lunch though , so it was n't too busy . we were seated by the window and were promptly served some sort of puffed rolls , with cheese and herbs infused . they were delicious !  we ordered the onion soup to start and i ordered parmesan chicken and my husband ordered a lamb burger . our food came and was delicious . the soup was probably my favorite part . we were feeling very full by the end and so declined dessert , but were still given some jellies and chocolate truffle and then were served a small chocolate mousse , on a decorated plate that said happy anniversary , which was a total surprise ( they had asked when i booked if it was a special occasion , but had said nothing while we were there ) . overall the service was great , the food delicious and the view wonderful . it was a great experience !
DOC123 i went here for the first time yesterday night to celebrate something with my family . several members of my family have been to this place before for summerlicious and really enjoyed it .  a nice atmosphere and excellent service , everyone ordered a variety of different dishes , many of which i tasted . i myself had a chicken salad and thought it was very good . my sister 's pasta dish was amazing though ! our waiter never rushed us out and was quick to refill water and bread and clear dishes , etc . that with an arm brace on !  prices are a little high , which is why i did n't give this place five stars ... i know those amazing places exist out there with great food and great prices , but this was a nice evening out .
DOC124 worst experience ever ! i had been there before to get my nails done and the first time was quite good , but the second time was a hot mess . it looked like a five year old did my nails for me . i went home and took the polish off . but this is the kicker : i could n't get an appointment for highlights at my regular salon and this was close by , so i decided to give it a try ( obviously the nail girl would n't be doing my hair ) . i went in and sat down the a woman with an eastern european accent came to talk with me . i showed her a picture of what i wanted and she showed me various hair dye samples ... .none of which looked like my picture , but i always assume the hair dressers know what 's best . now , you 're all thinking , `` ..and she did a poor job and you hated the colour ... '' right ? nope , she told me she could n't do my hair because i had lice ! of course i freaked out . another hair dresser came over to see if i was alright and i was mortified . she asked if i had experienced any itching . i said no . this hairdresser turned back to the original hairdresser and asked if maybe it was n't too bad yet , but original hairdresser said it was really , really bad . i freaked out and left ( obviously without having anything done ) and went to a shoppers and bought lice shampoo . i went home and had my husband look at my hair . he looked and looked and could find nothing . i still did n't want to take chances , so we tore the house apart and washed and bagged everything and i went to a walk-in clinic . the doctor looked at my head and also said there was nothing there ! since i was paranoid , i still used the shampoo and anytime my head itched in the slightest i went to examine it . but even with my husband and mother looking at my head , we never found a single thing . we did n't even see dandruff ! ! i went to a hairdresser a week later and they told me my hair was beautiful ... but dry at the ends ... yeah , because of the chemical-filled lice shampoo ! thanks a lot you crazy woman ! so ultimately , i never had lice . i do n't know if this woman just decided she did n't feel like doing my hair , or if she was delusional , but i sure wo n't be going back there ever again . no one else should either , unless you want to risk being embarrassed and inconvenienced .
DOC125 i love cupcakes . seriously ... .love affair ! so i 'm always on the lookout for new cupcake places . i was in scarborough town centre and came upon this kiosk . it 's not a storefront , but a rather ingenious booth , with colourful signs and a glass showcase full of cupcakes .  there is a long list of flavours and i suspect ( as with many places ) they make different cupcakes for different days .  i ordered 6 , which was $ 18 ... i know , it 's steep , that 's pretty standard . cupcake places seem to range from around the $ 2.25 mark to around $ 4\/cupcake . so these guys fall somewhere inbetween . but not cheap , so i expect excellence , needless to say .  now , here 's the strange thing . on their website each cupcake is listed as $ 2.90 ... .was this the case at the store ? ? i sure hope not . why would you have to pay more for buying more ? maybe it 's an ordering online thing ? anyway , my guess is that you 're paying $ 3\/cupcake at the store , or $ 18 for 6 . no real incentive to buy 6 . but i did , so moving on ... .  of course i chose a range of flavours : oreo cookie . chocolate with vanilla icing , salted caramel , lemon and a double chocolate .  over two days we managed to work our way through them ( myself and my husband ) and i nibbled the different flavours . lemon was my favorite , by far , with the salted caramel being a huge disappointment . it was entirely too salty . more salt than caramel . it was n't very good at all .  but that said , none of the cupcakes really blew me away . and in fact , they were very stale the next day , despite being stored in an airtight container , in the fridge . luckily , the cold buttercream frosting was easy to scoop off and once they had been in the oven for a few minutes , they softened up a bit .  the bottoms of the cupcakes stuck to the wrappers and the flavours were dull tasting and uninspired .  i was also surprised at the lack of creativity in terms of christmas flavours or designed . right before christmas you would expect some special flavours ... maybe a candy cane , or gingerbread cupcake . it would be so easy to switch out one flavour and try to get people to consider your product for a christmas party dessert .  having a little kiosk in a mall is a smart idea . sadly , this business is not one i think i will bother with again !
DOC126 i had a craving for mexican and came here ( ie . yelp ) to figure out what we could do , because there is a very real lack of good mexican food in toronto . this place had some good reviews and was n't too far away from us , so off we went .  parking in leaside can be pretty brutal , but we finally found a space and luckily , street parking is free .  the restaurant is tacky , stereotypical , but cozy and we were quickly greeted and seated .  the menu has basic mexican fare , burritos , fajitas , tacos , with your choice of meat . nothing too outside of the box , but that 's not necessarily a bad thing .  we ordered the guacamole to start and i ordered a chicken enchilada and my husband ordered the chimichanga .  the guacamole is very delicious and creamy , but we had to ask for more nachos and even then it felt like not enough . we were really loading up the chips with the guacamole !  the food came out and the was served with rice , a salad ( sort of italian dressing with feta and tomatoes ) and refried beans . the salad was pretty generic and the rice was bland , but the actual main courses were great and the refried beans helped with the spice ( i 'm a wimp ) .  the appetizer and our main courses came to $ 30 and we were very full .  service was good and food was good and it was n't too expensive . it was n't perfect , but we 'll totally be back !
DOC127 came here with my mother , husband and baby for brunch\/lunch . we were all quite happy with our choice . i think i was the `` winner '' by ordering the french toast . it was practically half a loaf of bread , covered with fruit and with delicious cinnamon butter . my husband ordered the stoney 's breakfast , which is your basic eggs , toast , bacon , etc , meal . my mother ordered the omelet . huge portions , but at around $ 11- $ 13 per breakfast meal , it was on the steep end of brunches and other than mine , i 'm not sure the price is warranted , especially since it 's a order at the counter , then find a seat with your number and wait for your meal type place . people were friendly and service was good ( for what it was ) . i would give it a try if i was in the area again .
DOC128 never eaten at this place before , but it 's always crowded and i decided that must mean something . i was running errands and had n't eaten the whole day , so decided to finally give this place a shot . i ordered a chicken sandwich and iced tea .  the iced tea does n't appear to be iced tea . it was a dark reddish colour and tasted like very watered down pomegranate juice . it was inedible . it was super gross . i was thinking that maybe they made a mistake , but i ca n't see on the menu anything else it might be and the girl who took my order , poured the drink and gave it to me said it was iced tea . sooooo ew .  sandwich was alright , but just alright . the `` aroma sauce '' which is a garlic mayo of sorts was good and the roasted red peppers and mozzerella on the sandwich were good . the bread was good , but the chicken was the sort of cheap , crappy chicken you find at subway , where it 's a sort of compressed chicken-like white meat , with fake grill marks on it . it had no taste and really took away from the overall sandwich .  there are soups , salads and of course hot beverages served at this place as well , so i 'm not writing it off just yet , but this was not a good first impression .
DOC129 solid soup place ... has an ever-so-slightly sketchy vibe to it ... you order your soup and the woman disappears into the back ... usually closes the sliding window so you ca n't see back there and then eventually emerges with your soup . also seems to sell a selection of jamaican movies in dvd from a glass case ... sort of random .  generous with the veggies , less so with dumplings , but all the soups have great flavour and are decently sized for the price . i wish they would offer some bread or crackers for the soup ... would be a nice , easy add-on . but this place is what it is and does n't bother with the bells and whistles . really deserves a 3.5 stars . the red bean is my fav by far .
DOC130 i would be more inclined to give this place 3-1\/2 stars , but since that 's not possible , i 'm rounding down .  i went here for sunday lunch with a group for winterlicious . for $ 15 we got a choice of appetizer , entree and dessert .  we arrived first and our table was waiting for us . the restaurant was not busy at that point and our waiter was very attentive with water and the wine menu .  once our party finally arrived we all ordered . i had their chipotle sweet potato & goat cheese dip , which was average . the salads looked much better and got better reviews . same with the soup . the dip was literally a dollap of dip at the side of the plate with some crostinis on the other end and 1 piece of pickled cauliflower and a few slices of onion in the middle . the dip was good , the pickled cauliflower alright . it was nice when all combined on the crostini ( pickled veggies , dip on top of crostini ) .  i had originally wanted to order the double pork slider , but i saw it arrive at someone else 's table and it was literally just the one , single mini pork sandwich , with a few thinly cut fries at the side . it looked good , but it was appetizer size , if that . the chicken sandwich was more reasonably sized , so i ordered that . it was good . i really liked the bread . the macaroni was also more reasonably sized . i sampled it and it was fine . did n't blow me away .  dessert was the highlight of the meal for everyone i think . some people ordered the mousse , which i thought was fine , but the people who ordered it loved , so there you have it . my husband loved his apple terrine , which i tried and was good . i liked the flavour of my creme brule very much , but the top was over toasted and had hardened to the consistency of a thin , hard candy . it was hard to break with my spoon and got stuck in my teeth .  the service was consistently good , so no complaints there . none of us had wine with our lunch ( although some had other drinks ) , so i ca n't comment there .  this is a tapas bar , so i expect sizes to be small . but when sizes are small i expect them to be priced accordingly and\/or to be in sharable portions . they gave the prices of each dish if you were to purchased them individually . these would all be hard to share and would n't really be worth it . they are nice as a winterlicious meal , but i 'm not sure this would be my first choice to go back to .

DOC126 i had a craving for mexican and came here ( ie . yelp ) to figure out what we could do , because there is a very real lack of good mexican food in toronto . this place had some good reviews and was n't too far away from us , so off we went .  parking in leaside can be pretty brutal , but we finally found a space and luckily , street parking is free .  the restaurant is tacky , stereotypical , but cozy and we were quickly greeted and seated .  the menu has basic mexican fare , burritos , fajitas , tacos , with your choice of meat . nothing too outside of the box , but that 's not necessarily a bad thing .  we ordered the guacamole to start and i ordered a chicken enchilada and my husband ordered the chimichanga .  the guacamole is very delicious and creamy , but we had to ask for more nachos and even then it felt like not enough . we were really loading up the chips with the guacamole !  the food came out and the was served with rice , a salad ( sort of italian dressing with feta and tomatoes ) and refried beans . the salad was pretty generic and the rice was bland , but the actual main courses were great and the refried beans helped with the spice ( i 'm a wimp ) .  the appetizer and our main courses came to $ 30 and we were very full .  service was good and food was good and it was n't too expensive . it was n't perfect , but we 'll totally be back !
DOC127 came here with my mother , husband and baby for brunch\/lunch . we were all quite happy with our choice . i think i was the `` winner '' by ordering the french toast . it was practically half a loaf of bread , covered with fruit and with delicious cinnamon butter . my husband ordered the stoney 's breakfast , which is your basic eggs , toast , bacon , etc , meal . my mother ordered the omelet . huge portions , but at around $ 11- $ 13 per breakfast meal , it was on the steep end of brunches and other than mine , i 'm not sure the price is warranted , especially since it 's a order at the counter , then find a seat with your number and wait for your meal type place . people were friendly and service was good ( for what it was ) . i would give it a try if i was in the area again .
DOC128 never eaten at this place before , but it 's always crowded and i decided that must mean something . i was running errands and had n't eaten the whole day , so decided to finally give this place a shot . i ordered a chicken sandwich and iced tea .  the iced tea does n't appear to be iced tea . it was a dark reddish colour and tasted like very watered down pomegranate juice . it was inedible . it was super gross . i was thinking that maybe they made a mistake , but i ca n't see on the menu anything else it might be and the girl who took my order , poured the drink and gave it to me said it was iced tea . sooooo ew .  sandwich was alright , but just alright . the `` aroma sauce '' which is a garlic mayo of sorts was good and the roasted red peppers and mozzerella on the sandwich were good . the bread was good , but the chicken was the sort of cheap , crappy chicken you find at subway , where it 's a sort of compressed chicken-like white meat , with fake grill marks on it . it had no taste and really took away from the overall sandwich .  there are soups , salads and of course hot beverages served at this place as well , so i 'm not writing it off just yet , but this was not a good first impression .
DOC129 solid soup place ... has an ever-so-slightly sketchy vibe to it ... you order your soup and the woman disappears into the back ... usually closes the sliding window so you ca n't see back there and then eventually emerges with your soup . also seems to sell a selection of jamaican movies in dvd from a glass case ... sort of random .  generous with the veggies , less so with dumplings , but all the soups have great flavour and are decently sized for the price . i wish they would offer some bread or crackers for the soup ... would be a nice , easy add-on . but this place is what it is and does n't bother with the bells and whistles . really deserves a 3.5 stars . the red bean is my fav by far .
DOC130 i would be more inclined to give this place 3-1\/2 stars , but since that 's not possible , i 'm rounding down .  i went here for sunday lunch with a group for winterlicious . for $ 15 we got a choice of appetizer , entree and dessert .  we arrived first and our table was waiting for us . the restaurant was not busy at that point and our waiter was very attentive with water and the wine menu .  once our party finally arrived we all ordered . i had their chipotle sweet potato & goat cheese dip , which was average . the salads looked much better and got better reviews . same with the soup . the dip was literally a dollap of dip at the side of the plate with some crostinis on the other end and 1 piece of pickled cauliflower and a few slices of onion in the middle . the dip was good , the pickled cauliflower alright . it was nice when all combined on the crostini ( pickled veggies , dip on top of crostini ) .  i had originally wanted to order the double pork slider , but i saw it arrive at someone else 's table and it was literally just the one , single mini pork sandwich , with a few thinly cut fries at the side . it looked good , but it was appetizer size , if that . the chicken sandwich was more reasonably sized , so i ordered that . it was good . i really liked the bread . the macaroni was also more reasonably sized . i sampled it and it was fine . did n't blow me away .  dessert was the highlight of the meal for everyone i think . some people ordered the mousse , which i thought was fine , but the people who ordered it loved , so there you have it . my husband loved his apple terrine , which i tried and was good . i liked the flavour of my creme brule very much , but the top was over toasted and had hardened to the consistency of a thin , hard candy . it was hard to break with my spoon and got stuck in my teeth .  the service was consistently good , so no complaints there . none of us had wine with our lunch ( although some had other drinks ) , so i ca n't comment there .  this is a tapas bar , so i expect sizes to be small . but when sizes are small i expect them to be priced accordingly and\/or to be in sharable portions . they gave the prices of each dish if you were to purchased them individually . these would all be hard to share and would n't really be worth it . they are nice as a winterlicious meal , but i 'm not sure this would be my first choice to go back to .
DOC131 i am surprised at the people complaining about the service , because we found the service to be fine . especially given how busy and cramped it was . there were no tables , but they got us seats at the bar . the music was maybe a little loud , but i enjoyed the 90s throwback that was happening . the place looks like a dive , it 's a total hole in the wall , with no signs to speak of , but i liked the weird atmosphere of weird , old `` ghetto blasters '' on the walls and pics of arnold in terminator . it 's random , just go with it ... but the food ... .oh the food ! we were told that the squash poutine was a must have , so i ordered that and the bulgogi cheese steak , while my friend ordered the poutine and the mackerel . the mackerel was served first . it arrived raw , on a platter and a torch was taken to it to sear the outside and that was it . my friend allowed me a bite and it was so fresh tasting , with a delicious marinade . next came by bulgogi sandwich . fresh , delicious bread and amazing bulgogi . was very pleased . finally the `` poutines '' arrived . i should say that it was not what we were expecting . i assumed it would be squash on top of fries . but in fact the squash was the fries . they were lightly fried and covered in a variety of sauce `` gravies '' and scallions and some other stuff that i could neither make out , nor even see clearly ( dim lighting ) . it does n't matter okay ... .this stuff was heaven ! both my friend and i took a bite and looked at each other ... and proclaimed our new favourite food . other people in our party got the wings , which looked amazing and they said they were and the loosey , which was also proclaimed as delicious . so basically there were no wrong moves . the drink menu was very adventurous ... more so than we were , because we did n't take the plunge , although it was fun sitting at the bar and watching the bartender creating them . and splitting the bill for my friend with two others ( her birthday ) , my two `` tapas '' and a generic alcoholic beverage came to just under $ 30 . the prices are extremely reasonable ... and honestly once you try this stuff ... i mean , i do n't want to give them any ideas , but i would have paid more for that fine , fine food . i will be back . need me some more of that poutine !
DOC132 our friends got the groupon for four people and took us along . i 'm very pleased we went ! having never had ethiopian food before , we were curious , but wary . the deal really helped us dive in . it included two appetizers , four main courses and two desserts . we started with two appetizers , one i was n't a huge fan of ( a `` salad '' with a strong vinegar taste and jalapenos , which i found too strong , although other people in my group really liked it ) . the other appetizer was similar to an indian samosa ( similar name too , but i ca n't remember exactly what it was called ) . they were stuff with lentils and had a flaky shell . they were delicious . but , their appetizers were only made for three people , so there were only three of them ! seems silly when you offer a four person deal . we each ordered a different main course and they brought them on one large platter , so we could all share . we ordered two vegetarian options , one of lentils and one of chickpeas and one of chicken and one of beef . basically , the meals are more sauces than anything and they are served with injera , which are sort of bland , cold , bread-like stuff , which comes rolled up . they 're nothing special , but they 're only used as a sort of utensil , because you use it to scoop up the food . the food was delicious ! i especially liked the chickpea dish . every one of us ended up liking a different dish the best ! worked out well . i personally found the beef dish very tough though . once we were stuff with the food , we ordered two desserts . we especially liked the cheesecake ( which is obviously not ethiopian ) . we asked if they had any ethiopian coffees and they said yes . they showed us the beans , as they were being roasted . then they came back out with a sort of stone earthenware kettle and some small cups . the coffee was so rich , it was almost like chocolate . they also served it with a large basket of popcorn , which was just perfectly prepared . it was such a nice after dinner snack ! i would totally come here just to order the coffee ! it would have been a very expensive dinner without the groupon , so i 'm not sure i would make this a regularly destination , but as i said , the coffee was fantastic and it 's a fun thing to try , especially with friends . make sure they 're good ones , that you do n't mind getting messy in front of !
DOC133 a little on the pricey end for baked goods , but the baked goods are good . also their coffee products are great . the set up is annoying ( order your desserts on one side and coffee and food on another side ) , but the service is good and overall they do a good job .
DOC134 my sister told me that origin was well known for their delicious brunches , so we made a trip there to see if this was the case . origin is pretty new in our area and is very large , but nicely decorated . my only comment would be the washrooms , which feature communal sinks , the kind you find in elementary schools , where you step on the thing at the bottom and water comes out all around . besides not being very effective to quickly wash hands , it 's also wasteful if you 're the only one there . strange concept . throw back , but not necessarily one wants to remember during their brunch . now onto the important part ... the food and service . service started out alright and then immediately got very slow . it took some time to get our drink orders and then took a long time to get our actual orders . i ordered their french toast , my sister ordered tostada and my husband skipped brunch and ordered a meal they offered of a burger , fries covered in some chorizo and sauce and a float . i also ordered a side of bacon ... and was told that they were out of bacon ... which meant any orders that would have come with bacon were out entirely , or would be served without bacon . i 'm sorry but a brunch restaurant without bacon ? even the waitress admitted it was ridiculous . we also shared a plate of buscuits with their preserves . these were delicious . apparently my meal was the one that took the longest . the others got their food and we still waited for five minutes before mine came out . who knew it would take so long to put a couple of pieces of bread on a plate and cover them with blueberry preserves ? my sister said her tostada was quite good . my french toast was nothing special . the toast was `` fancy '' , rounded pieces , on top of each other with whipped cream and blueberries in between . the `` maple '' which was supposed to be on the plate ( maple syrup i 'm guessing ) was barely present . tasted like something i could have created with some ease . my husband 's dish was the best by far . his burger was juicy and this fries were great . the float was a little silly ... this big , meaty burger and fries covered in more meat ... paired with a cream soda float in pink and white layers . ( not insulting , we just got a laugh ) . nothing was cheap and then we had to wait a long time again to get our bill and pay . this was all strange because the restaurant was not particularly busy . because the brunch itself did n't blow me away , food shortages and service , i 'm not sure if i would bother with brunch again . oliver and bonicini in the actual mall has a much better brunch . i might try this again for lunch or dinner though .
DOC135 the saga has finished ... .because i needed to end this bs and move on .  so first off , the store owner responded to my complaints ... by blaming me . apparently it is my fault they sent the wrong thing , because i sent an email and then followed it up with a phone call ... which confused them and made them think there were two orders or something . which makes zero sense , because two orders were not sent . and the person i was speaking with on the phone responded to the emails i sent with codes to try out ... .so i have a hard time believing that they were confused by what was going on and thought that the phone order and email order were different .  they also told me they blocked me on instagram because i was body shaming their models . i want to be very clear on this . i never once body shamed , or made any comments on instagram about their models . i asked why they were promoting clothing they do n't even have in stock on instagram ... apparently that equates to body shaming to them .  they also informed me that because they had to mail so many orders to me ( 3 ) , they were going to start to charge me for shipping . they seemed to forget that i had also been paying to ship items back to them and that i had specifically chosen times when they had free shipping promos taking place to place orders . it 's not that they were n't charging me for shipping ... it was that i was taking advantage of their own promos . apparently i ca n't use their promos anymore , because they have placed an arbitrary rules on how many times you can make a return now . at least for me .  they did not address the code not working .  i responded and expressed continued frustration at their lack of ownership over their mistakes and how poor their customer service continued to be .  then i did some research and sent another email . instead of returning the dress i would donate it to dress for success . i said this seemed like a better choice than continuing to mail clothing back and forth . my request to them was that they take the would be money they would spend on continuing to mail me clothing and take some ownership for their mistakes and channel it into something good . i asked that they take the remaining $ 9.98 credit i had and put it towards them making a small donation , either monetarily or a piece of clothing , also to the charity . i stated that their continued neglect for customer service and lack of ownership over repeated problems should be owned up to , but if they would n't do it for me , perhaps they would be willing to do so for someone in need . i said that would conclude our business and bring something good out of this ridiculousness .  a few hours later i received an email with a letter of thanks for a donation made to dress for success ... for the amount of $ 10 via the store ... .so my remainder amount i had paid for and big sis closet 's contribution of ... .two cents . their generosity is astounding . now , i do n't know that they have n't made their own donation and just not told me of course ... i 'll let you guys decide whether you want to give them the benefit of the doubt in that regard . but given that they have taken zero responsibility for the continued poor management and customer service , well ... i think you can guess what my thoughts are on the subject . no further correspondence was sent from the actual store .  but at any rate , i am donating the new dress to dress for success ( along with my $ 9.98 ) and i am officially done with this store for good . and i sincerely hope that people read this review and think twice about shopping here . the clothes are not good quality , but more than that ... i have never experienced such insanely bad management and customer service in my life . zero regard for their customers , zero regard for their own mistakes , zero regard for taking ownership of ... anything ! just excuse after excuse and then turning the blame around on their customers . these people do not deserve your business and quite frankly ... ladies you deserve better . better clothing ( i have now purchased 6 items and been dissatisfied with the quality of all of them ... loose threads , flimsy , cheap fabric , wrong stitching for the fabric , no lining , incorrect fit for size , etc . ) and a greater degree of respect as a consumer .
DOC136 went here with my sister and her boyfriend for some drinks . we were hungry and ordered a few appetizers to share . drinks were fine ( my mix drink was on the very small side ) , but the food was really good . the perogies and `` chips '' and dip were excellent . the service was good and the atmosphere was nice , for such a small place . bathrooms were also nice , clean , etc . only problem is that some of the tables are so small , it 's really hard to use them . we were at a very small one and even though we fit around it alright , a guy walking by knocked a beer over with his coat and it dumped all down me . i mean all over me . it 's not the bar 's fault the guy knocked the glass , but if the table was a bit bigger we would have had more room to put the glass further in , so it would n't have gotten knocked in the first place . the fact is , if you 're going to serve food people need a place to put it . a few slightly bigger tables would go a long way .
DOC121 after being scared away from rock & rita 's , we ended up at this place , which was , if nothing else , quieter .  i 'll start by saying that the hostess and our server were both lovely and they 're really what earned the single star , because they were sweet , but the food was just horrible .  i ordered a simple grilled cheese sandwich . i asked the server if it was processed cheese , or `` real '' cheese in the sandwich and he had no idea what i was talking about . i tried to clarify by saying , `` is it like kraft single slices , or deli cheese ? '' he said it was `` good '' . this really should have been a sign and i could probably fault the waiter for this , since you should know what you 're serving , but he was so sweet , i could n't be mad !  my husband ordered a hot dog of sorts .  i asked if there was a way to substitute fries for a salad . there was not , but the server hooked me up and brought me a salad anyway ( no charge ) . i asked for sweet potato fries with the sandwich .  of course , my sandwich was made with plasticy , processed cheese , that was melted to the point of cheeze-wiz and was inedible . i took one bite of the sandwich and could n't do another . i got regular fries , instead of sweet potato ( did n't bother complaining , because i got the free salad , so whatever ... like i said , nice server ! ) my husband 's food was fine , although nothing special . they were good with the refills of our drinks .  anyway , as nice as the servers were , it was n't good . i would avoid eating here if i could .
DOC122 we got recommendations for this place from my parents and so , for our anniversary , we booked here . we were told though that it was first come , first served , in terms of having the ideal seats by the windows that overlook the fountains of the bellagio and the strip . we went for lunch though , so it was n't too busy . we were seated by the window and were promptly served some sort of puffed rolls , with cheese and herbs infused . they were delicious !  we ordered the onion soup to start and i ordered parmesan chicken and my husband ordered a lamb burger . our food came and was delicious . the soup was probably my favorite part . we were feeling very full by the end and so declined dessert , but were still given some jellies and chocolate truffle and then were served a small chocolate mousse , on a decorated plate that said happy anniversary , which was a total surprise ( they had asked when i booked if it was a special occasion , but had said nothing while we were there ) . overall the service was great , the food delicious and the view wonderful . it was a great experience !
DOC123 i went here for the first time yesterday night to celebrate something with my family . several members of my family have been to this place before for summerlicious and really enjoyed it .  a nice atmosphere and excellent service , everyone ordered a variety of different dishes , many of which i tasted . i myself had a chicken salad and thought it was very good . my sister 's pasta dish was amazing though ! our waiter never rushed us out and was quick to refill water and bread and clear dishes , etc . that with an arm brace on !  prices are a little high , which is why i did n't give this place five stars ... i know those amazing places exist out there with great food and great prices , but this was a nice evening out .
DOC124 worst experience ever ! i had been there before to get my nails done and the first time was quite good , but the second time was a hot mess . it looked like a five year old did my nails for me . i went home and took the polish off . but this is the kicker : i could n't get an appointment for highlights at my regular salon and this was close by , so i decided to give it a try ( obviously the nail girl would n't be doing my hair ) . i went in and sat down the a woman with an eastern european accent came to talk with me . i showed her a picture of what i wanted and she showed me various hair dye samples ... .none of which looked like my picture , but i always assume the hair dressers know what 's best . now , you 're all thinking , `` ..and she did a poor job and you hated the colour ... '' right ? nope , she told me she could n't do my hair because i had lice ! of course i freaked out . another hair dresser came over to see if i was alright and i was mortified . she asked if i had experienced any itching . i said no . this hairdresser turned back to the original hairdresser and asked if maybe it was n't too bad yet , but original hairdresser said it was really , really bad . i freaked out and left ( obviously without having anything done ) and went to a shoppers and bought lice shampoo . i went home and had my husband look at my hair . he looked and looked and could find nothing . i still did n't want to take chances , so we tore the house apart and washed and bagged everything and i went to a walk-in clinic . the doctor looked at my head and also said there was nothing there ! since i was paranoid , i still used the shampoo and anytime my head itched in the slightest i went to examine it . but even with my husband and mother looking at my head , we never found a single thing . we did n't even see dandruff ! ! i went to a hairdresser a week later and they told me my hair was beautiful ... but dry at the ends ... yeah , because of the chemical-filled lice shampoo ! thanks a lot you crazy woman ! so ultimately , i never had lice . i do n't know if this woman just decided she did n't feel like doing my hair , or if she was delusional , but i sure wo n't be going back there ever again . no one else should either , unless you want to risk being embarrassed and inconvenienced .

DOC130 i would be more inclined to give this place 3-1\/2 stars , but since that 's not possible , i 'm rounding down .  i went here for sunday lunch with a group for winterlicious . for $ 15 we got a choice of appetizer , entree and dessert .  we arrived first and our table was waiting for us . the restaurant was not busy at that point and our waiter was very attentive with water and the wine menu .  once our party finally arrived we all ordered . i had their chipotle sweet potato & goat cheese dip , which was average . the salads looked much better and got better reviews . same with the soup . the dip was literally a dollap of dip at the side of the plate with some crostinis on the other end and 1 piece of pickled cauliflower and a few slices of onion in the middle . the dip was good , the pickled cauliflower alright . it was nice when all combined on the crostini ( pickled veggies , dip on top of crostini ) .  i had originally wanted to order the double pork slider , but i saw it arrive at someone else 's table and it was literally just the one , single mini pork sandwich , with a few thinly cut fries at the side . it looked good , but it was appetizer size , if that . the chicken sandwich was more reasonably sized , so i ordered that . it was good . i really liked the bread . the macaroni was also more reasonably sized . i sampled it and it was fine . did n't blow me away .  dessert was the highlight of the meal for everyone i think . some people ordered the mousse , which i thought was fine , but the people who ordered it loved , so there you have it . my husband loved his apple terrine , which i tried and was good . i liked the flavour of my creme brule very much , but the top was over toasted and had hardened to the consistency of a thin , hard candy . it was hard to break with my spoon and got stuck in my teeth .  the service was consistently good , so no complaints there . none of us had wine with our lunch ( although some had other drinks ) , so i ca n't comment there .  this is a tapas bar , so i expect sizes to be small . but when sizes are small i expect them to be priced accordingly and\/or to be in sharable portions . they gave the prices of each dish if you were to purchased them individually . these would all be hard to share and would n't really be worth it . they are nice as a winterlicious meal , but i 'm not sure this would be my first choice to go back to .
DOC131 i am surprised at the people complaining about the service , because we found the service to be fine . especially given how busy and cramped it was . there were no tables , but they got us seats at the bar . the music was maybe a little loud , but i enjoyed the 90s throwback that was happening . the place looks like a dive , it 's a total hole in the wall , with no signs to speak of , but i liked the weird atmosphere of weird , old `` ghetto blasters '' on the walls and pics of arnold in terminator . it 's random , just go with it ... but the food ... .oh the food ! we were told that the squash poutine was a must have , so i ordered that and the bulgogi cheese steak , while my friend ordered the poutine and the mackerel . the mackerel was served first . it arrived raw , on a platter and a torch was taken to it to sear the outside and that was it . my friend allowed me a bite and it was so fresh tasting , with a delicious marinade . next came by bulgogi sandwich . fresh , delicious bread and amazing bulgogi . was very pleased . finally the `` poutines '' arrived . i should say that it was not what we were expecting . i assumed it would be squash on top of fries . but in fact the squash was the fries . they were lightly fried and covered in a variety of sauce `` gravies '' and scallions and some other stuff that i could neither make out , nor even see clearly ( dim lighting ) . it does n't matter okay ... .this stuff was heaven ! both my friend and i took a bite and looked at each other ... and proclaimed our new favourite food . other people in our party got the wings , which looked amazing and they said they were and the loosey , which was also proclaimed as delicious . so basically there were no wrong moves . the drink menu was very adventurous ... more so than we were , because we did n't take the plunge , although it was fun sitting at the bar and watching the bartender creating them . and splitting the bill for my friend with two others ( her birthday ) , my two `` tapas '' and a generic alcoholic beverage came to just under $ 30 . the prices are extremely reasonable ... and honestly once you try this stuff ... i mean , i do n't want to give them any ideas , but i would have paid more for that fine , fine food . i will be back . need me some more of that poutine !
DOC132 our friends got the groupon for four people and took us along . i 'm very pleased we went ! having never had ethiopian food before , we were curious , but wary . the deal really helped us dive in . it included two appetizers , four main courses and two desserts . we started with two appetizers , one i was n't a huge fan of ( a `` salad '' with a strong vinegar taste and jalapenos , which i found too strong , although other people in my group really liked it ) . the other appetizer was similar to an indian samosa ( similar name too , but i ca n't remember exactly what it was called ) . they were stuff with lentils and had a flaky shell . they were delicious . but , their appetizers were only made for three people , so there were only three of them ! seems silly when you offer a four person deal . we each ordered a different main course and they brought them on one large platter , so we could all share . we ordered two vegetarian options , one of lentils and one of chickpeas and one of chicken and one of beef . basically , the meals are more sauces than anything and they are served with injera , which are sort of bland , cold , bread-like stuff , which comes rolled up . they 're nothing special , but they 're only used as a sort of utensil , because you use it to scoop up the food . the food was delicious ! i especially liked the chickpea dish . every one of us ended up liking a different dish the best ! worked out well . i personally found the beef dish very tough though . once we were stuff with the food , we ordered two desserts . we especially liked the cheesecake ( which is obviously not ethiopian ) . we asked if they had any ethiopian coffees and they said yes . they showed us the beans , as they were being roasted . then they came back out with a sort of stone earthenware kettle and some small cups . the coffee was so rich , it was almost like chocolate . they also served it with a large basket of popcorn , which was just perfectly prepared . it was such a nice after dinner snack ! i would totally come here just to order the coffee ! it would have been a very expensive dinner without the groupon , so i 'm not sure i would make this a regularly destination , but as i said , the coffee was fantastic and it 's a fun thing to try , especially with friends . make sure they 're good ones , that you do n't mind getting messy in front of !
DOC133 a little on the pricey end for baked goods , but the baked goods are good . also their coffee products are great . the set up is annoying ( order your desserts on one side and coffee and food on another side ) , but the service is good and overall they do a good job .
DOC134 my sister told me that origin was well known for their delicious brunches , so we made a trip there to see if this was the case . origin is pretty new in our area and is very large , but nicely decorated . my only comment would be the washrooms , which feature communal sinks , the kind you find in elementary schools , where you step on the thing at the bottom and water comes out all around . besides not being very effective to quickly wash hands , it 's also wasteful if you 're the only one there . strange concept . throw back , but not necessarily one wants to remember during their brunch . now onto the important part ... the food and service . service started out alright and then immediately got very slow . it took some time to get our drink orders and then took a long time to get our actual orders . i ordered their french toast , my sister ordered tostada and my husband skipped brunch and ordered a meal they offered of a burger , fries covered in some chorizo and sauce and a float . i also ordered a side of bacon ... and was told that they were out of bacon ... which meant any orders that would have come with bacon were out entirely , or would be served without bacon . i 'm sorry but a brunch restaurant without bacon ? even the waitress admitted it was ridiculous . we also shared a plate of buscuits with their preserves . these were delicious . apparently my meal was the one that took the longest . the others got their food and we still waited for five minutes before mine came out . who knew it would take so long to put a couple of pieces of bread on a plate and cover them with blueberry preserves ? my sister said her tostada was quite good . my french toast was nothing special . the toast was `` fancy '' , rounded pieces , on top of each other with whipped cream and blueberries in between . the `` maple '' which was supposed to be on the plate ( maple syrup i 'm guessing ) was barely present . tasted like something i could have created with some ease . my husband 's dish was the best by far . his burger was juicy and this fries were great . the float was a little silly ... this big , meaty burger and fries covered in more meat ... paired with a cream soda float in pink and white layers . ( not insulting , we just got a laugh ) . nothing was cheap and then we had to wait a long time again to get our bill and pay . this was all strange because the restaurant was not particularly busy . because the brunch itself did n't blow me away , food shortages and service , i 'm not sure if i would bother with brunch again . oliver and bonicini in the actual mall has a much better brunch . i might try this again for lunch or dinner though .
DOC135 the saga has finished ... .because i needed to end this bs and move on .  so first off , the store owner responded to my complaints ... by blaming me . apparently it is my fault they sent the wrong thing , because i sent an email and then followed it up with a phone call ... which confused them and made them think there were two orders or something . which makes zero sense , because two orders were not sent . and the person i was speaking with on the phone responded to the emails i sent with codes to try out ... .so i have a hard time believing that they were confused by what was going on and thought that the phone order and email order were different .  they also told me they blocked me on instagram because i was body shaming their models . i want to be very clear on this . i never once body shamed , or made any comments on instagram about their models . i asked why they were promoting clothing they do n't even have in stock on instagram ... apparently that equates to body shaming to them .  they also informed me that because they had to mail so many orders to me ( 3 ) , they were going to start to charge me for shipping . they seemed to forget that i had also been paying to ship items back to them and that i had specifically chosen times when they had free shipping promos taking place to place orders . it 's not that they were n't charging me for shipping ... it was that i was taking advantage of their own promos . apparently i ca n't use their promos anymore , because they have placed an arbitrary rules on how many times you can make a return now . at least for me .  they did not address the code not working .  i responded and expressed continued frustration at their lack of ownership over their mistakes and how poor their customer service continued to be .  then i did some research and sent another email . instead of returning the dress i would donate it to dress for success . i said this seemed like a better choice than continuing to mail clothing back and forth . my request to them was that they take the would be money they would spend on continuing to mail me clothing and take some ownership for their mistakes and channel it into something good . i asked that they take the remaining $ 9.98 credit i had and put it towards them making a small donation , either monetarily or a piece of clothing , also to the charity . i stated that their continued neglect for customer service and lack of ownership over repeated problems should be owned up to , but if they would n't do it for me , perhaps they would be willing to do so for someone in need . i said that would conclude our business and bring something good out of this ridiculousness .  a few hours later i received an email with a letter of thanks for a donation made to dress for success ... for the amount of $ 10 via the store ... .so my remainder amount i had paid for and big sis closet 's contribution of ... .two cents . their generosity is astounding . now , i do n't know that they have n't made their own donation and just not told me of course ... i 'll let you guys decide whether you want to give them the benefit of the doubt in that regard . but given that they have taken zero responsibility for the continued poor management and customer service , well ... i think you can guess what my thoughts are on the subject . no further correspondence was sent from the actual store .  but at any rate , i am donating the new dress to dress for success ( along with my $ 9.98 ) and i am officially done with this store for good . and i sincerely hope that people read this review and think twice about shopping here . the clothes are not good quality , but more than that ... i have never experienced such insanely bad management and customer service in my life . zero regard for their customers , zero regard for their own mistakes , zero regard for taking ownership of ... anything ! just excuse after excuse and then turning the blame around on their customers . these people do not deserve your business and quite frankly ... ladies you deserve better . better clothing ( i have now purchased 6 items and been dissatisfied with the quality of all of them ... loose threads , flimsy , cheap fabric , wrong stitching for the fabric , no lining , incorrect fit for size , etc . ) and a greater degree of respect as a consumer .
DOC136 went here with my sister and her boyfriend for some drinks . we were hungry and ordered a few appetizers to share . drinks were fine ( my mix drink was on the very small side ) , but the food was really good . the perogies and `` chips '' and dip were excellent . the service was good and the atmosphere was nice , for such a small place . bathrooms were also nice , clean , etc . only problem is that some of the tables are so small , it 's really hard to use them . we were at a very small one and even though we fit around it alright , a guy walking by knocked a beer over with his coat and it dumped all down me . i mean all over me . it 's not the bar 's fault the guy knocked the glass , but if the table was a bit bigger we would have had more room to put the glass further in , so it would n't have gotten knocked in the first place . the fact is , if you 're going to serve food people need a place to put it . a few slightly bigger tables would go a long way .
DOC121 after being scared away from rock & rita 's , we ended up at this place , which was , if nothing else , quieter .  i 'll start by saying that the hostess and our server were both lovely and they 're really what earned the single star , because they were sweet , but the food was just horrible .  i ordered a simple grilled cheese sandwich . i asked the server if it was processed cheese , or `` real '' cheese in the sandwich and he had no idea what i was talking about . i tried to clarify by saying , `` is it like kraft single slices , or deli cheese ? '' he said it was `` good '' . this really should have been a sign and i could probably fault the waiter for this , since you should know what you 're serving , but he was so sweet , i could n't be mad !  my husband ordered a hot dog of sorts .  i asked if there was a way to substitute fries for a salad . there was not , but the server hooked me up and brought me a salad anyway ( no charge ) . i asked for sweet potato fries with the sandwich .  of course , my sandwich was made with plasticy , processed cheese , that was melted to the point of cheeze-wiz and was inedible . i took one bite of the sandwich and could n't do another . i got regular fries , instead of sweet potato ( did n't bother complaining , because i got the free salad , so whatever ... like i said , nice server ! ) my husband 's food was fine , although nothing special . they were good with the refills of our drinks .  anyway , as nice as the servers were , it was n't good . i would avoid eating here if i could .
DOC122 we got recommendations for this place from my parents and so , for our anniversary , we booked here . we were told though that it was first come , first served , in terms of having the ideal seats by the windows that overlook the fountains of the bellagio and the strip . we went for lunch though , so it was n't too busy . we were seated by the window and were promptly served some sort of puffed rolls , with cheese and herbs infused . they were delicious !  we ordered the onion soup to start and i ordered parmesan chicken and my husband ordered a lamb burger . our food came and was delicious . the soup was probably my favorite part . we were feeling very full by the end and so declined dessert , but were still given some jellies and chocolate truffle and then were served a small chocolate mousse , on a decorated plate that said happy anniversary , which was a total surprise ( they had asked when i booked if it was a special occasion , but had said nothing while we were there ) . overall the service was great , the food delicious and the view wonderful . it was a great experience !
DOC123 i went here for the first time yesterday night to celebrate something with my family . several members of my family have been to this place before for summerlicious and really enjoyed it .  a nice atmosphere and excellent service , everyone ordered a variety of different dishes , many of which i tasted . i myself had a chicken salad and thought it was very good . my sister 's pasta dish was amazing though ! our waiter never rushed us out and was quick to refill water and bread and clear dishes , etc . that with an arm brace on !  prices are a little high , which is why i did n't give this place five stars ... i know those amazing places exist out there with great food and great prices , but this was a nice evening out .
DOC124 worst experience ever ! i had been there before to get my nails done and the first time was quite good , but the second time was a hot mess . it looked like a five year old did my nails for me . i went home and took the polish off . but this is the kicker : i could n't get an appointment for highlights at my regular salon and this was close by , so i decided to give it a try ( obviously the nail girl would n't be doing my hair ) . i went in and sat down the a woman with an eastern european accent came to talk with me . i showed her a picture of what i wanted and she showed me various hair dye samples ... .none of which looked like my picture , but i always assume the hair dressers know what 's best . now , you 're all thinking , `` ..and she did a poor job and you hated the colour ... '' right ? nope , she told me she could n't do my hair because i had lice ! of course i freaked out . another hair dresser came over to see if i was alright and i was mortified . she asked if i had experienced any itching . i said no . this hairdresser turned back to the original hairdresser and asked if maybe it was n't too bad yet , but original hairdresser said it was really , really bad . i freaked out and left ( obviously without having anything done ) and went to a shoppers and bought lice shampoo . i went home and had my husband look at my hair . he looked and looked and could find nothing . i still did n't want to take chances , so we tore the house apart and washed and bagged everything and i went to a walk-in clinic . the doctor looked at my head and also said there was nothing there ! since i was paranoid , i still used the shampoo and anytime my head itched in the slightest i went to examine it . but even with my husband and mother looking at my head , we never found a single thing . we did n't even see dandruff ! ! i went to a hairdresser a week later and they told me my hair was beautiful ... but dry at the ends ... yeah , because of the chemical-filled lice shampoo ! thanks a lot you crazy woman ! so ultimately , i never had lice . i do n't know if this woman just decided she did n't feel like doing my hair , or if she was delusional , but i sure wo n't be going back there ever again . no one else should either , unless you want to risk being embarrassed and inconvenienced .
DOC125 i love cupcakes . seriously ... .love affair ! so i 'm always on the lookout for new cupcake places . i was in scarborough town centre and came upon this kiosk . it 's not a storefront , but a rather ingenious booth , with colourful signs and a glass showcase full of cupcakes .  there is a long list of flavours and i suspect ( as with many places ) they make different cupcakes for different days .  i ordered 6 , which was $ 18 ... i know , it 's steep , that 's pretty standard . cupcake places seem to range from around the $ 2.25 mark to around $ 4\/cupcake . so these guys fall somewhere inbetween . but not cheap , so i expect excellence , needless to say .  now , here 's the strange thing . on their website each cupcake is listed as $ 2.90 ... .was this the case at the store ? ? i sure hope not . why would you have to pay more for buying more ? maybe it 's an ordering online thing ? anyway , my guess is that you 're paying $ 3\/cupcake at the store , or $ 18 for 6 . no real incentive to buy 6 . but i did , so moving on ... .  of course i chose a range of flavours : oreo cookie . chocolate with vanilla icing , salted caramel , lemon and a double chocolate .  over two days we managed to work our way through them ( myself and my husband ) and i nibbled the different flavours . lemon was my favorite , by far , with the salted caramel being a huge disappointment . it was entirely too salty . more salt than caramel . it was n't very good at all .  but that said , none of the cupcakes really blew me away . and in fact , they were very stale the next day , despite being stored in an airtight container , in the fridge . luckily , the cold buttercream frosting was easy to scoop off and once they had been in the oven for a few minutes , they softened up a bit .  the bottoms of the cupcakes stuck to the wrappers and the flavours were dull tasting and uninspired .  i was also surprised at the lack of creativity in terms of christmas flavours or designed . right before christmas you would expect some special flavours ... maybe a candy cane , or gingerbread cupcake . it would be so easy to switch out one flavour and try to get people to consider your product for a christmas party dessert .  having a little kiosk in a mall is a smart idea . sadly , this business is not one i think i will bother with again !
DOC126 i had a craving for mexican and came here ( ie . yelp ) to figure out what we could do , because there is a very real lack of good mexican food in toronto . this place had some good reviews and was n't too far away from us , so off we went .  parking in leaside can be pretty brutal , but we finally found a space and luckily , street parking is free .  the restaurant is tacky , stereotypical , but cozy and we were quickly greeted and seated .  the menu has basic mexican fare , burritos , fajitas , tacos , with your choice of meat . nothing too outside of the box , but that 's not necessarily a bad thing .  we ordered the guacamole to start and i ordered a chicken enchilada and my husband ordered the chimichanga .  the guacamole is very delicious and creamy , but we had to ask for more nachos and even then it felt like not enough . we were really loading up the chips with the guacamole !  the food came out and the was served with rice , a salad ( sort of italian dressing with feta and tomatoes ) and refried beans . the salad was pretty generic and the rice was bland , but the actual main courses were great and the refried beans helped with the spice ( i 'm a wimp ) .  the appetizer and our main courses came to $ 30 and we were very full .  service was good and food was good and it was n't too expensive . it was n't perfect , but we 'll totally be back !
DOC127 came here with my mother , husband and baby for brunch\/lunch . we were all quite happy with our choice . i think i was the `` winner '' by ordering the french toast . it was practically half a loaf of bread , covered with fruit and with delicious cinnamon butter . my husband ordered the stoney 's breakfast , which is your basic eggs , toast , bacon , etc , meal . my mother ordered the omelet . huge portions , but at around $ 11- $ 13 per breakfast meal , it was on the steep end of brunches and other than mine , i 'm not sure the price is warranted , especially since it 's a order at the counter , then find a seat with your number and wait for your meal type place . people were friendly and service was good ( for what it was ) . i would give it a try if i was in the area again .

'' right ? nope , she told me she could n't do my hair because i had lice ! of course i freaked out . another hair dresser came over to see if i was alright and i was mortified . she asked if i had experienced any itching . i said no . this hairdresser turned back to the original hairdresser and asked if maybe it was n't too bad yet , but original hairdresser said it was really , really bad . i freaked out and left ( obviously without having anything done ) and went to a shoppers and bought lice shampoo . i went home and had my husband look at my hair . he looked and looked and could find nothing . i still did n't want to take chances , so we tore the house apart and washed and bagged everything and i went to a walk-in clinic . the doctor looked at my head and also said there was nothing there ! since i was paranoid , i still used the shampoo and anytime my head itched in the slightest i went to examine it . but even with my husband and mother looking at my head , we never found a single thing . we did n't even see dandruff ! ! i went to a hairdresser a week later and they told me my hair was beautiful ... but dry at the ends ... yeah , because of the chemical-filled lice shampoo ! thanks a lot you crazy woman ! so ultimately , i never had lice . i do n't know if this woman just decided she did n't feel like doing my hair , or if she was delusional , but i sure wo n't be going back there ever again . no one else should either , unless you want to risk being embarrassed and inconvenienced .
DOC125 i love cupcakes . seriously ... .love affair ! so i 'm always on the lookout for new cupcake places . i was in scarborough town centre and came upon this kiosk . it 's not a storefront , but a rather ingenious booth , with colourful signs and a glass showcase full of cupcakes .  there is a long list of flavours and i suspect ( as with many places ) they make different cupcakes for different days .  i ordered 6 , which was $ 18 ... i know , it 's steep , that 's pretty standard . cupcake places seem to range from around the $ 2.25 mark to around $ 4\/cupcake . so these guys fall somewhere inbetween . but not cheap , so i expect excellence , needless to say .  now , here 's the strange thing . on their website each cupcake is listed as $ 2.90 ... .was this the case at the store ? ? i sure hope not . why would you have to pay more for buying more ? maybe it 's an ordering online thing ? anyway , my guess is that you 're paying $ 3\/cupcake at the store , or $ 18 for 6 . no real incentive to buy 6 . but i did , so moving on ... .  of course i chose a range of flavours : oreo cookie . chocolate with vanilla icing , salted caramel , lemon and a double chocolate .  over two days we managed to work our way through them ( myself and my husband ) and i nibbled the different flavours . lemon was my favorite , by far , with the salted caramel being a huge disappointment . it was entirely too salty . more salt than caramel . it was n't very good at all .  but that said , none of the cupcakes really blew me away . and in fact , they were very stale the next day , despite being stored in an airtight container , in the fridge . luckily , the cold buttercream frosting was easy to scoop off and once they had been in the oven for a few minutes , they softened up a bit .  the bottoms of the cupcakes stuck to the wrappers and the flavours were dull tasting and uninspired .  i was also surprised at the lack of creativity in terms of christmas flavours or designed . right before christmas you would expect some special flavours ... maybe a candy cane , or gingerbread cupcake . it would be so easy to switch out one flavour and try to get people to consider your product for a christmas party dessert .  having a little kiosk in a mall is a smart idea . sadly , this business is not one i think i will bother with again !
DOC126 i had a craving for mexican and came here ( ie . yelp ) to figure out what we could do , because there is a very real lack of good mexican food in toronto . this place had some good reviews and was n't too far away from us , so off we went .  parking in leaside can be pretty brutal , but we finally found a space and luckily , street parking is free .  the restaurant is tacky , stereotypical , but cozy and we were quickly greeted and seated .  the menu has basic mexican fare , burritos , fajitas , tacos , with your choice of meat . nothing too outside of the box , but that 's not necessarily a bad thing .  we ordered the guacamole to start and i ordered a chicken enchilada and my husband ordered the chimichanga .  the guacamole is very delicious and creamy , but we had to ask for more nachos and even then it felt like not enough . we were really loading up the chips with the guacamole !  the food came out and the was served with rice , a salad ( sort of italian dressing with feta and tomatoes ) and refried beans . the salad was pretty generic and the rice was bland , but the actual main courses were great and the refried beans helped with the spice ( i 'm a wimp ) .  the appetizer and our main courses came to $ 30 and we were very full .  service was good and food was good and it was n't too expensive . it was n't perfect , but we 'll totally be back !
DOC127 came here with my mother , husband and baby for brunch\/lunch . we were all quite happy with our choice . i think i was the `` winner '' by ordering the french toast . it was practically half a loaf of bread , covered with fruit and with delicious cinnamon butter . my husband ordered the stoney 's breakfast , which is your basic eggs , toast , bacon , etc , meal . my mother ordered the omelet . huge portions , but at around $ 11- $ 13 per breakfast meal , it was on the steep end of brunches and other than mine , i 'm not sure the price is warranted , especially since it 's a order at the counter , then find a seat with your number and wait for your meal type place . people were friendly and service was good ( for what it was ) . i would give it a try if i was in the area again .
DOC128 never eaten at this place before , but it 's always crowded and i decided that must mean something . i was running errands and had n't eaten the whole day , so decided to finally give this place a shot . i ordered a chicken sandwich and iced tea .  the iced tea does n't appear to be iced tea . it was a dark reddish colour and tasted like very watered down pomegranate juice . it was inedible . it was super gross . i was thinking that maybe they made a mistake , but i ca n't see on the menu anything else it might be and the girl who took my order , poured the drink and gave it to me said it was iced tea . sooooo ew .  sandwich was alright , but just alright . the `` aroma sauce '' which is a garlic mayo of sorts was good and the roasted red peppers and mozzerella on the sandwich were good . the bread was good , but the chicken was the sort of cheap , crappy chicken you find at subway , where it 's a sort of compressed chicken-like white meat , with fake grill marks on it . it had no taste and really took away from the overall sandwich .  there are soups , salads and of course hot beverages served at this place as well , so i 'm not writing it off just yet , but this was not a good first impression .
DOC129 solid soup place ... has an ever-so-slightly sketchy vibe to it ... you order your soup and the woman disappears into the back ... usually closes the sliding window so you ca n't see back there and then eventually emerges with your soup . also seems to sell a selection of jamaican movies in dvd from a glass case ... sort of random .  generous with the veggies , less so with dumplings , but all the soups have great flavour and are decently sized for the price . i wish they would offer some bread or crackers for the soup ... would be a nice , easy add-on . but this place is what it is and does n't bother with the bells and whistles . really deserves a 3.5 stars . the red bean is my fav by far .
DOC130 i would be more inclined to give this place 3-1\/2 stars , but since that 's not possible , i 'm rounding down .  i went here for sunday lunch with a group for winterlicious . for $ 15 we got a choice of appetizer , entree and dessert .  we arrived first and our table was waiting for us . the restaurant was not busy at that point and our waiter was very attentive with water and the wine menu .  once our party finally arrived we all ordered . i had their chipotle sweet potato & goat cheese dip , which was average . the salads looked much better and got better reviews . same with the soup . the dip was literally a dollap of dip at the side of the plate with some crostinis on the other end and 1 piece of pickled cauliflower and a few slices of onion in the middle . the dip was good , the pickled cauliflower alright . it was nice when all combined on the crostini ( pickled veggies , dip on top of crostini ) .  i had originally wanted to order the double pork slider , but i saw it arrive at someone else 's table and it was literally just the one , single mini pork sandwich , with a few thinly cut fries at the side . it looked good , but it was appetizer size , if that . the chicken sandwich was more reasonably sized , so i ordered that . it was good . i really liked the bread . the macaroni was also more reasonably sized . i sampled it and it was fine . did n't blow me away .  dessert was the highlight of the meal for everyone i think . some people ordered the mousse , which i thought was fine , but the people who ordered it loved , so there you have it . my husband loved his apple terrine , which i tried and was good . i liked the flavour of my creme brule very much , but the top was over toasted and had hardened to the consistency of a thin , hard candy . it was hard to break with my spoon and got stuck in my teeth .  the service was consistently good , so no complaints there . none of us had wine with our lunch ( although some had other drinks ) , so i ca n't comment there .  this is a tapas bar , so i expect sizes to be small . but when sizes are small i expect them to be priced accordingly and\/or to be in sharable portions . they gave the prices of each dish if you were to purchased them individually . these would all be hard to share and would n't really be worth it . they are nice as a winterlicious meal , but i 'm not sure this would be my first choice to go back to .
DOC131 i am surprised at the people complaining about the service , because we found the service to be fine . especially given how busy and cramped it was . there were no tables , but they got us seats at the bar . the music was maybe a little loud , but i enjoyed the 90s throwback that was happening . the place looks like a dive , it 's a total hole in the wall , with no signs to speak of , but i liked the weird atmosphere of weird , old `` ghetto blasters '' on the walls and pics of arnold in terminator . it 's random , just go with it ... but the food ... .oh the food ! we were told that the squash poutine was a must have , so i ordered that and the bulgogi cheese steak , while my friend ordered the poutine and the mackerel . the mackerel was served first . it arrived raw , on a platter and a torch was taken to it to sear the outside and that was it . my friend allowed me a bite and it was so fresh tasting , with a delicious marinade . next came by bulgogi sandwich . fresh , delicious bread and amazing bulgogi . was very pleased . finally the `` poutines '' arrived . i should say that it was not what we were expecting . i assumed it would be squash on top of fries . but in fact the squash was the fries . they were lightly fried and covered in a variety of sauce `` gravies '' and scallions and some other stuff that i could neither make out , nor even see clearly ( dim lighting ) . it does n't matter okay ... .this stuff was heaven ! both my friend and i took a bite and looked at each other ... and proclaimed our new favourite food . other people in our party got the wings , which looked amazing and they said they were and the loosey , which was also proclaimed as delicious . so basically there were no wrong moves . the drink menu was very adventurous ... more so than we were , because we did n't take the plunge , although it was fun sitting at the bar and watching the bartender creating them . and splitting the bill for my friend with two others ( her birthday ) , my two `` tapas '' and a generic alcoholic beverage came to just under $ 30 . the prices are extremely reasonable ... and honestly once you try this stuff ... i mean , i do n't want to give them any ideas , but i would have paid more for that fine , fine food . i will be back . need me some more of that poutine !
DOC132 our friends got the groupon for four people and took us along . i 'm very pleased we went ! having never had ethiopian food before , we were curious , but wary . the deal really helped us dive in . it included two appetizers , four main courses and two desserts . we started with two appetizers , one i was n't a huge fan of ( a `` salad '' with a strong vinegar taste and jalapenos , which i found too strong , although other people in my group really liked it ) . the other appetizer was similar to an indian samosa ( similar name too , but i ca n't remember exactly what it was called ) . they were stuff with lentils and had a flaky shell . they were delicious . but , their appetizers were only made for three people , so there were only three of them ! seems silly when you offer a four person deal . we each ordered a different main course and they brought them on one large platter , so we could all share . we ordered two vegetarian options , one of lentils and one of chickpeas and one of chicken and one of beef . basically , the meals are more sauces than anything and they are served with injera , which are sort of bland , cold , bread-like stuff , which comes rolled up . they 're nothing special , but they 're only used as a sort of utensil , because you use it to scoop up the food . the food was delicious ! i especially liked the chickpea dish . every one of us ended up liking a different dish the best ! worked out well . i personally found the beef dish very tough though . once we were stuff with the food , we ordered two desserts . we especially liked the cheesecake ( which is obviously not ethiopian ) . we asked if they had any ethiopian coffees and they said yes . they showed us the beans , as they were being roasted . then they came back out with a sort of stone earthenware kettle and some small cups . the coffee was so rich , it was almost like chocolate . they also served it with a large basket of popcorn , which was just perfectly prepared . it was such a nice after dinner snack ! i would totally come here just to order the coffee ! it would have been a very expensive dinner without the groupon , so i 'm not sure i would make this a regularly destination , but as i said , the coffee was fantastic and it 's a fun thing to try , especially with friends . make sure they 're good ones , that you do n't mind getting messy in front of !
DOC133 a little on the pricey end for baked goods , but the baked goods are good . also their coffee products are great . the set up is annoying ( order your desserts on one side and coffee and food on another side ) , but the service is good and overall they do a good job .
DOC134 my sister told me that origin was well known for their delicious brunches , so we made a trip there to see if this was the case . origin is pretty new in our area and is very large , but nicely decorated . my only comment would be the washrooms , which feature communal sinks , the kind you find in elementary schools , where you step on the thing at the bottom and water comes out all around . besides not being very effective to quickly wash hands , it 's also wasteful if you 're the only one there . strange concept . throw back , but not necessarily one wants to remember during their brunch . now onto the important part ... the food and service . service started out alright and then immediately got very slow . it took some time to get our drink orders and then took a long time to get our actual orders . i ordered their french toast , my sister ordered tostada and my husband skipped brunch and ordered a meal they offered of a burger , fries covered in some chorizo and sauce and a float . i also ordered a side of bacon ... and was told that they were out of bacon ... which meant any orders that would have come with bacon were out entirely , or would be served without bacon . i 'm sorry but a brunch restaurant without bacon ? even the waitress admitted it was ridiculous . we also shared a plate of buscuits with their preserves . these were delicious . apparently my meal was the one that took the longest . the others got their food and we still waited for five minutes before mine came out . who knew it would take so long to put a couple of pieces of bread on a plate and cover them with blueberry preserves ? my sister said her tostada was quite good . my french toast was nothing special . the toast was `` fancy '' , rounded pieces , on top of each other with whipped cream and blueberries in between . the `` maple '' which was supposed to be on the plate ( maple syrup i 'm guessing ) was barely present . tasted like something i could have created with some ease . my husband 's dish was the best by far . his burger was juicy and this fries were great . the float was a little silly ... this big , meaty burger and fries covered in more meat ... paired with a cream soda float in pink and white layers . ( not insulting , we just got a laugh ) . nothing was cheap and then we had to wait a long time again to get our bill and pay . this was all strange because the restaurant was not particularly busy . because the brunch itself did n't blow me away , food shortages and service , i 'm not sure if i would bother with brunch again . oliver and bonicini in the actual mall has a much better brunch . i might try this again for lunch or dinner though .
DOC135 the saga has finished ... .because i needed to end this bs and move on .  so first off , the store owner responded to my complaints ... by blaming me . apparently it is my fault they sent the wrong thing , because i sent an email and then followed it up with a phone call ... which confused them and made them think there were two orders or something . which makes zero sense , because two orders were not sent . and the person i was speaking with on the phone responded to the emails i sent with codes to try out ... .so i have a hard time believing that they were confused by what was going on and thought that the phone order and email order were different .  they also told me they blocked me on instagram because i was body shaming their models . i want to be very clear on this . i never once body shamed , or made any comments on instagram about their models . i asked why they were promoting clothing they do n't even have in stock on instagram ... apparently that equates to body shaming to them .  they also informed me that because they had to mail so many orders to me ( 3 ) , they were going to start to charge me for shipping . they seemed to forget that i had also been paying to ship items back to them and that i had specifically chosen times when they had free shipping promos taking place to place orders . it 's not that they were n't charging me for shipping ... it was that i was taking advantage of their own promos . apparently i ca n't use their promos anymore , because they have placed an arbitrary rules on how many times you can make a return now . at least for me .  they did not address the code not working .  i responded and expressed continued frustration at their lack of ownership over their mistakes and how poor their customer service continued to be .  then i did some research and sent another email . instead of returning the dress i would donate it to dress for success . i said this seemed like a better choice than continuing to mail clothing back and forth . my request to them was that they take the would be money they would spend on continuing to mail me clothing and take some ownership for their mistakes and channel it into something good . i asked that they take the remaining $ 9.98 credit i had and put it towards them making a small donation , either monetarily or a piece of clothing , also to the charity . i stated that their continued neglect for customer service and lack of ownership over repeated problems should be owned up to , but if they would n't do it for me , perhaps they would be willing to do so for someone in need . i said that would conclude our business and bring something good out of this ridiculousness .  a few hours later i received an email with a letter of thanks for a donation made to dress for success ... for the amount of $ 10 via the store ... .so my remainder amount i had paid for and big sis closet 's contribution of ... .two cents . their generosity is astounding . now , i do n't know that they have n't made their own donation and just not told me of course ... i 'll let you guys decide whether you want to give them the benefit of the doubt in that regard . but given that they have taken zero responsibility for the continued poor management and customer service , well ... i think you can guess what my thoughts are on the subject . no further correspondence was sent from the actual store .  but at any rate , i am donating the new dress to dress for success ( along with my $ 9.98 ) and i am officially done with this store for good . and i sincerely hope that people read this review and think twice about shopping here . the clothes are not good quality , but more than that ... i have never experienced such insanely bad management and customer service in my life . zero regard for their customers , zero regard for their own mistakes , zero regard for taking ownership of ... anything ! just excuse after excuse and then turning the blame around on their customers . these people do not deserve your business and quite frankly ... ladies you deserve better . better clothing ( i have now purchased 6 items and been dissatisfied with the quality of all of them ... loose threads , flimsy , cheap fabric , wrong stitching for the fabric , no lining , incorrect fit for size , etc . ) and a greater degree of respect as a consumer .
DOC136 went here with my sister and her boyfriend for some drinks . we were hungry and ordered a few appetizers to share . drinks were fine ( my mix drink was on the very small side ) , but the food was really good . the perogies and `` chips '' and dip were excellent . the service was good and the atmosphere was nice , for such a small place . bathrooms were also nice , clean , etc . only problem is that some of the tables are so small , it 's really hard to use them . we were at a very small one and even though we fit around it alright , a guy walking by knocked a beer over with his coat and it dumped all down me . i mean all over me . it 's not the bar 's fault the guy knocked the glass , but if the table was a bit bigger we would have had more room to put the glass further in , so it would n't have gotten knocked in the first place . the fact is , if you 're going to serve food people need a place to put it . a few slightly bigger tables would go a long way .
DOC121 after being scared away from rock & rita 's , we ended up at this place , which was , if nothing else , quieter .  i 'll start by saying that the hostess and our server were both lovely and they 're really what earned the single star , because they were sweet , but the food was just horrible .  i ordered a simple grilled cheese sandwich . i asked the server if it was processed cheese , or `` real '' cheese in the sandwich and he had no idea what i was talking about . i tried to clarify by saying , `` is it like kraft single slices , or deli cheese ? '' he said it was `` good '' . this really should have been a sign and i could probably fault the waiter for this , since you should know what you 're serving , but he was so sweet , i could n't be mad !  my husband ordered a hot dog of sorts .  i asked if there was a way to substitute fries for a salad . there was not , but the server hooked me up and brought me a salad anyway ( no charge ) . i asked for sweet potato fries with the sandwich .  of course , my sandwich was made with plasticy , processed cheese , that was melted to the point of cheeze-wiz and was inedible . i took one bite of the sandwich and could n't do another . i got regular fries , instead of sweet potato ( did n't bother complaining , because i got the free salad , so whatever ... like i said , nice server ! ) my husband 's food was fine , although nothing special . they were good with the refills of our drinks .  anyway , as nice as the servers were , it was n't good . i would avoid eating here if i could .
DOC122 we got recommendations for this place from my parents and so , for our anniversary , we booked here . we were told though that it was first come , first served , in terms of having the ideal seats by the windows that overlook the fountains of the bellagio and the strip . we went for lunch though , so it was n't too busy . we were seated by the window and were promptly served some sort of puffed rolls , with cheese and herbs infused . they were delicious !  we ordered the onion soup to start and i ordered parmesan chicken and my husband ordered a lamb burger . our food came and was delicious . the soup was probably my favorite part . we were feeling very full by the end and so declined dessert , but were still given some jellies and chocolate truffle and then were served a small chocolate mousse , on a decorated plate that said happy anniversary , which was a total surprise ( they had asked when i booked if it was a special occasion , but had said nothing while we were there ) . overall the service was great , the food delicious and the view wonderful . it was a great experience !
DOC123 i went here for the first time yesterday night to celebrate something with my family . several members of my family have been to this place before for summerlicious and really enjoyed it .  a nice atmosphere and excellent service , everyone ordered a variety of different dishes , many of which i tasted . i myself had a chicken salad and thought it was very good . my sister 's pasta dish was amazing though ! our waiter never rushed us out and was quick to refill water and bread and clear dishes , etc . that with an arm brace on !  prices are a little high , which is why i did n't give this place five stars ... i know those amazing places exist out there with great food and great prices , but this was a nice evening out .

DOC129 solid soup place ... has an ever-so-slightly sketchy vibe to it ... you order your soup and the woman disappears into the back ... usually closes the sliding window so you ca n't see back there and then eventually emerges with your soup . also seems to sell a selection of jamaican movies in dvd from a glass case ... sort of random .  generous with the veggies , less so with dumplings , but all the soups have great flavour and are decently sized for the price . i wish they would offer some bread or crackers for the soup ... would be a nice , easy add-on . but this place is what it is and does n't bother with the bells and whistles . really deserves a 3.5 stars . the red bean is my fav by far .
DOC130 i would be more inclined to give this place 3-1\/2 stars , but since that 's not possible , i 'm rounding down .  i went here for sunday lunch with a group for winterlicious . for $ 15 we got a choice of appetizer , entree and dessert .  we arrived first and our table was waiting for us . the restaurant was not busy at that point and our waiter was very attentive with water and the wine menu .  once our party finally arrived we all ordered . i had their chipotle sweet potato & goat cheese dip , which was average . the salads looked much better and got better reviews . same with the soup . the dip was literally a dollap of dip at the side of the plate with some crostinis on the other end and 1 piece of pickled cauliflower and a few slices of onion in the middle . the dip was good , the pickled cauliflower alright . it was nice when all combined on the crostini ( pickled veggies , dip on top of crostini ) .  i had originally wanted to order the double pork slider , but i saw it arrive at someone else 's table and it was literally just the one , single mini pork sandwich , with a few thinly cut fries at the side . it looked good , but it was appetizer size , if that . the chicken sandwich was more reasonably sized , so i ordered that . it was good . i really liked the bread . the macaroni was also more reasonably sized . i sampled it and it was fine . did n't blow me away .  dessert was the highlight of the meal for everyone i think . some people ordered the mousse , which i thought was fine , but the people who ordered it loved , so there you have it . my husband loved his apple terrine , which i tried and was good . i liked the flavour of my creme brule very much , but the top was over toasted and had hardened to the consistency of a thin , hard candy . it was hard to break with my spoon and got stuck in my teeth .  the service was consistently good , so no complaints there . none of us had wine with our lunch ( although some had other drinks ) , so i ca n't comment there .  this is a tapas bar , so i expect sizes to be small . but when sizes are small i expect them to be priced accordingly and\/or to be in sharable portions . they gave the prices of each dish if you were to purchased them individually . these would all be hard to share and would n't really be worth it . they are nice as a winterlicious meal , but i 'm not sure this would be my first choice to go back to .
DOC131 i am surprised at the people complaining about the service , because we found the service to be fine . especially given how busy and cramped it was . there were no tables , but they got us seats at the bar . the music was maybe a little loud , but i enjoyed the 90s throwback that was happening . the place looks like a dive , it 's a total hole in the wall , with no signs to speak of , but i liked the weird atmosphere of weird , old `` ghetto blasters '' on the walls and pics of arnold in terminator . it 's random , just go with it ... but the food ... .oh the food ! we were told that the squash poutine was a must have , so i ordered that and the bulgogi cheese steak , while my friend ordered the poutine and the mackerel . the mackerel was served first . it arrived raw , on a platter and a torch was taken to it to sear the outside and that was it . my friend allowed me a bite and it was so fresh tasting , with a delicious marinade . next came by bulgogi sandwich . fresh , delicious bread and amazing bulgogi . was very pleased . finally the `` poutines '' arrived . i should say that it was not what we were expecting . i assumed it would be squash on top of fries . but in fact the squash was the fries . they were lightly fried and covered in a variety of sauce `` gravies '' and scallions and some other stuff that i could neither make out , nor even see clearly ( dim lighting ) . it does n't matter okay ... .this stuff was heaven ! both my friend and i took a bite and looked at each other ... and proclaimed our new favourite food . other people in our party got the wings , which looked amazing and they said they were and the loosey , which was also proclaimed as delicious . so basically there were no wrong moves . the drink menu was very adventurous ... more so than we were , because we did n't take the plunge , although it was fun sitting at the bar and watching the bartender creating them . and splitting the bill for my friend with two others ( her birthday ) , my two `` tapas '' and a generic alcoholic beverage came to just under $ 30 . the prices are extremely reasonable ... and honestly once you try this stuff ... i mean , i do n't want to give them any ideas , but i would have paid more for that fine , fine food . i will be back . need me some more of that poutine !
DOC132 our friends got the groupon for four people and took us along . i 'm very pleased we went ! having never had ethiopian food before , we were curious , but wary . the deal really helped us dive in . it included two appetizers , four main courses and two desserts . we started with two appetizers , one i was n't a huge fan of ( a `` salad '' with a strong vinegar taste and jalapenos , which i found too strong , although other people in my group really liked it ) . the other appetizer was similar to an indian samosa ( similar name too , but i ca n't remember exactly what it was called ) . they were stuff with lentils and had a flaky shell . they were delicious . but , their appetizers were only made for three people , so there were only three of them ! seems silly when you offer a four person deal . we each ordered a different main course and they brought them on one large platter , so we could all share . we ordered two vegetarian options , one of lentils and one of chickpeas and one of chicken and one of beef . basically , the meals are more sauces than anything and they are served with injera , which are sort of bland , cold , bread-like stuff , which comes rolled up . they 're nothing special , but they 're only used as a sort of utensil , because you use it to scoop up the food . the food was delicious ! i especially liked the chickpea dish . every one of us ended up liking a different dish the best ! worked out well . i personally found the beef dish very tough though . once we were stuff with the food , we ordered two desserts . we especially liked the cheesecake ( which is obviously not ethiopian ) . we asked if they had any ethiopian coffees and they said yes . they showed us the beans , as they were being roasted . then they came back out with a sort of stone earthenware kettle and some small cups . the coffee was so rich , it was almost like chocolate . they also served it with a large basket of popcorn , which was just perfectly prepared . it was such a nice after dinner snack ! i would totally come here just to order the coffee ! it would have been a very expensive dinner without the groupon , so i 'm not sure i would make this a regularly destination , but as i said , the coffee was fantastic and it 's a fun thing to try , especially with friends . make sure they 're good ones , that you do n't mind getting messy in front of !
DOC133 a little on the pricey end for baked goods , but the baked goods are good . also their coffee products are great . the set up is annoying ( order your desserts on one side and coffee and food on another side ) , but the service is good and overall they do a good job .
DOC134 my sister told me that origin was well known for their delicious brunches , so we made a trip there to see if this was the case . origin is pretty new in our area and is very large , but nicely decorated . my only comment would be the washrooms , which feature communal sinks , the kind you find in elementary schools , where you step on the thing at the bottom and water comes out all around . besides not being very effective to quickly wash hands , it 's also wasteful if you 're the only one there . strange concept . throw back , but not necessarily one wants to remember during their brunch . now onto the important part ... the food and service . service started out alright and then immediately got very slow . it took some time to get our drink orders and then took a long time to get our actual orders . i ordered their french toast , my sister ordered tostada and my husband skipped brunch and ordered a meal they offered of a burger , fries covered in some chorizo and sauce and a float . i also ordered a side of bacon ... and was told that they were out of bacon ... which meant any orders that would have come with bacon were out entirely , or would be served without bacon . i 'm sorry but a brunch restaurant without bacon ? even the waitress admitted it was ridiculous . we also shared a plate of buscuits with their preserves . these were delicious . apparently my meal was the one that took the longest . the others got their food and we still waited for five minutes before mine came out . who knew it would take so long to put a couple of pieces of bread on a plate and cover them with blueberry preserves ? my sister said her tostada was quite good . my french toast was nothing special . the toast was `` fancy '' , rounded pieces , on top of each other with whipped cream and blueberries in between . the `` maple '' which was supposed to be on the plate ( maple syrup i 'm guessing ) was barely present . tasted like something i could have created with some ease . my husband 's dish was the best by far . his burger was juicy and this fries were great . the float was a little silly ... this big , meaty burger and fries covered in more meat ... paired with a cream soda float in pink and white layers . ( not insulting , we just got a laugh ) . nothing was cheap and then we had to wait a long time again to get our bill and pay . this was all strange because the restaurant was not particularly busy . because the brunch itself did n't blow me away , food shortages and service , i 'm not sure if i would bother with brunch again . oliver and bonicini in the actual mall has a much better brunch . i might try this again for lunch or dinner though .
DOC135 the saga has finished ... .because i needed to end this bs and move on .  so first off , the store owner responded to my complaints ... by blaming me . apparently it is my fault they sent the wrong thing , because i sent an email and then followed it up with a phone call ... which confused them and made them think there were two orders or something . which makes zero sense , because two orders were not sent . and the person i was speaking with on the phone responded to the emails i sent with codes to try out ... .so i have a hard time believing that they were confused by what was going on and thought that the phone order and email order were different .  they also told me they blocked me on instagram because i was body shaming their models . i want to be very clear on this . i never once body shamed , or made any comments on instagram about their models . i asked why they were promoting clothing they do n't even have in stock on instagram ... apparently that equates to body shaming to them .  they also informed me that because they had to mail so many orders to me ( 3 ) , they were going to start to charge me for shipping . they seemed to forget that i had also been paying to ship items back to them and that i had specifically chosen times when they had free shipping promos taking place to place orders . it 's not that they were n't charging me for shipping ... it was that i was taking advantage of their own promos . apparently i ca n't use their promos anymore , because they have placed an arbitrary rules on how many times you can make a return now . at least for me .  they did not address the code not working .  i responded and expressed continued frustration at their lack of ownership over their mistakes and how poor their customer service continued to be .  then i did some research and sent another email . instead of returning the dress i would donate it to dress for success . i said this seemed like a better choice than continuing to mail clothing back and forth . my request to them was that they take the would be money they would spend on continuing to mail me clothing and take some ownership for their mistakes and channel it into something good . i asked that they take the remaining $ 9.98 credit i had and put it towards them making a small donation , either monetarily or a piece of clothing , also to the charity . i stated that their continued neglect for customer service and lack of ownership over repeated problems should be owned up to , but if they would n't do it for me , perhaps they would be willing to do so for someone in need . i said that would conclude our business and bring something good out of this ridiculousness .  a few hours later i received an email with a letter of thanks for a donation made to dress for success ... for the amount of $ 10 via the store ... .so my remainder amount i had paid for and big sis closet 's contribution of ... .two cents . their generosity is astounding . now , i do n't know that they have n't made their own donation and just not told me of course ... i 'll let you guys decide whether you want to give them the benefit of the doubt in that regard . but given that they have taken zero responsibility for the continued poor management and customer service , well ... i think you can guess what my thoughts are on the subject . no further correspondence was sent from the actual store .  but at any rate , i am donating the new dress to dress for success ( along with my $ 9.98 ) and i am officially done with this store for good . and i sincerely hope that people read this review and think twice about shopping here . the clothes are not good quality , but more than that ... i have never experienced such insanely bad management and customer service in my life . zero regard for their customers , zero regard for their own mistakes , zero regard for taking ownership of ... anything ! just excuse after excuse and then turning the blame around on their customers . these people do not deserve your business and quite frankly ... ladies you deserve better . better clothing ( i have now purchased 6 items and been dissatisfied with the quality of all of them ... loose threads , flimsy , cheap fabric , wrong stitching for the fabric , no lining , incorrect fit for size , etc . ) and a greater degree of respect as a consumer .
DOC136 went here with my sister and her boyfriend for some drinks . we were hungry and ordered a few appetizers to share . drinks were fine ( my mix drink was on the very small side ) , but the food was really good . the perogies and `` chips '' and dip were excellent . the service was good and the atmosphere was nice , for such a small place . bathrooms were also nice , clean , etc . only problem is that some of the tables are so small , it 's really hard to use them . we were at a very small one and even though we fit around it alright , a guy walking by knocked a beer over with his coat and it dumped all down me . i mean all over me . it 's not the bar 's fault the guy knocked the glass , but if the table was a bit bigger we would have had more room to put the glass further in , so it would n't have gotten knocked in the first place . the fact is , if you 're going to serve food people need a place to put it . a few slightly bigger tables would go a long way .
DOC121 after being scared away from rock & rita 's , we ended up at this place , which was , if nothing else , quieter .  i 'll start by saying that the hostess and our server were both lovely and they 're really what earned the single star , because they were sweet , but the food was just horrible .  i ordered a simple grilled cheese sandwich . i asked the server if it was processed cheese , or `` real '' cheese in the sandwich and he had no idea what i was talking about . i tried to clarify by saying , `` is it like kraft single slices , or deli cheese ? '' he said it was `` good '' . this really should have been a sign and i could probably fault the waiter for this , since you should know what you 're serving , but he was so sweet , i could n't be mad !  my husband ordered a hot dog of sorts .  i asked if there was a way to substitute fries for a salad . there was not , but the server hooked me up and brought me a salad anyway ( no charge ) . i asked for sweet potato fries with the sandwich .  of course , my sandwich was made with plasticy , processed cheese , that was melted to the point of cheeze-wiz and was inedible . i took one bite of the sandwich and could n't do another . i got regular fries , instead of sweet potato ( did n't bother complaining , because i got the free salad , so whatever ... like i said , nice server ! ) my husband 's food was fine , although nothing special . they were good with the refills of our drinks .  anyway , as nice as the servers were , it was n't good . i would avoid eating here if i could .
DOC122 we got recommendations for this place from my parents and so , for our anniversary , we booked here . we were told though that it was first come , first served , in terms of having the ideal seats by the windows that overlook the fountains of the bellagio and the strip . we went for lunch though , so it was n't too busy . we were seated by the window and were promptly served some sort of puffed rolls , with cheese and herbs infused . they were delicious !  we ordered the onion soup to start and i ordered parmesan chicken and my husband ordered a lamb burger . our food came and was delicious . the soup was probably my favorite part . we were feeling very full by the end and so declined dessert , but were still given some jellies and chocolate truffle and then were served a small chocolate mousse , on a decorated plate that said happy anniversary , which was a total surprise ( they had asked when i booked if it was a special occasion , but had said nothing while we were there ) . overall the service was great , the food delicious and the view wonderful . it was a great experience !
DOC123 i went here for the first time yesterday night to celebrate something with my family . several members of my family have been to this place before for summerlicious and really enjoyed it .  a nice atmosphere and excellent service , everyone ordered a variety of different dishes , many of which i tasted . i myself had a chicken salad and thought it was very good . my sister 's pasta dish was amazing though ! our waiter never rushed us out and was quick to refill water and bread and clear dishes , etc . that with an arm brace on !  prices are a little high , which is why i did n't give this place five stars ... i know those amazing places exist out there with great food and great prices , but this was a nice evening out .
DOC124 worst experience ever ! i had been there before to get my nails done and the first time was quite good , but the second time was a hot mess . it looked like a five year old did my nails for me . i went home and took the polish off . but this is the kicker : i could n't get an appointment for highlights at my regular salon and this was close by , so i decided to give it a try ( obviously the nail girl would n't be doing my hair ) . i went in and sat down the a woman with an eastern european accent came to talk with me . i showed her a picture of what i wanted and she showed me various hair dye samples ... .none of which looked like my picture , but i always assume the hair dressers know what 's best . now , you 're all thinking , `` ..and she did a poor job and you hated the colour ... '' right ? nope , she told me she could n't do my hair because i had lice ! of course i freaked out . another hair dresser came over to see if i was alright and i was mortified . she asked if i had experienced any itching . i said no . this hairdresser turned back to the original hairdresser and asked if maybe it was n't too bad yet , but original hairdresser said it was really , really bad . i freaked out and left ( obviously without having anything done ) and went to a shoppers and bought lice shampoo . i went home and had my husband look at my hair . he looked and looked and could find nothing . i still did n't want to take chances , so we tore the house apart and washed and bagged everything and i went to a walk-in clinic . the doctor looked at my head and also said there was nothing there ! since i was paranoid , i still used the shampoo and anytime my head itched in the slightest i went to examine it . but even with my husband and mother looking at my head , we never found a single thing . we did n't even see dandruff ! ! i went to a hairdresser a week later and they told me my hair was beautiful ... but dry at the ends ... yeah , because of the chemical-filled lice shampoo ! thanks a lot you crazy woman ! so ultimately , i never had lice . i do n't know if this woman just decided she did n't feel like doing my hair , or if she was delusional , but i sure wo n't be going back there ever again . no one else should either , unless you want to risk being embarrassed and inconvenienced .
DOC125 i love cupcakes . seriously ... .love affair ! so i 'm always on the lookout for new cupcake places . i was in scarborough town centre and came upon this kiosk . it 's not a storefront , but a rather ingenious booth , with colourful signs and a glass showcase full of cupcakes .  there is a long list of flavours and i suspect ( as with many places ) they make different cupcakes for different days .  i ordered 6 , which was $ 18 ... i know , it 's steep , that 's pretty standard . cupcake places seem to range from around the $ 2.25 mark to around $ 4\/cupcake . so these guys fall somewhere inbetween . but not cheap , so i expect excellence , needless to say .  now , here 's the strange thing . on their website each cupcake is listed as $ 2.90 ... .was this the case at the store ? ? i sure hope not . why would you have to pay more for buying more ? maybe it 's an ordering online thing ? anyway , my guess is that you 're paying $ 3\/cupcake at the store , or $ 18 for 6 . no real incentive to buy 6 . but i did , so moving on ... .  of course i chose a range of flavours : oreo cookie . chocolate with vanilla icing , salted caramel , lemon and a double chocolate .  over two days we managed to work our way through them ( myself and my husband ) and i nibbled the different flavours . lemon was my favorite , by far , with the salted caramel being a huge disappointment . it was entirely too salty . more salt than caramel . it was n't very good at all .  but that said , none of the cupcakes really blew me away . and in fact , they were very stale the next day , despite being stored in an airtight container , in the fridge . luckily , the cold buttercream frosting was easy to scoop off and once they had been in the oven for a few minutes , they softened up a bit .  the bottoms of the cupcakes stuck to the wrappers and the flavours were dull tasting and uninspired .  i was also surprised at the lack of creativity in terms of christmas flavours or designed . right before christmas you would expect some special flavours ... maybe a candy cane , or gingerbread cupcake . it would be so easy to switch out one flavour and try to get people to consider your product for a christmas party dessert .  having a little kiosk in a mall is a smart idea . sadly , this business is not one i think i will bother with again !
DOC126 i had a craving for mexican and came here ( ie . yelp ) to figure out what we could do , because there is a very real lack of good mexican food in toronto . this place had some good reviews and was n't too far away from us , so off we went .  parking in leaside can be pretty brutal , but we finally found a space and luckily , street parking is free .  the restaurant is tacky , stereotypical , but cozy and we were quickly greeted and seated .  the menu has basic mexican fare , burritos , fajitas , tacos , with your choice of meat . nothing too outside of the box , but that 's not necessarily a bad thing .  we ordered the guacamole to start and i ordered a chicken enchilada and my husband ordered the chimichanga .  the guacamole is very delicious and creamy , but we had to ask for more nachos and even then it felt like not enough . we were really loading up the chips with the guacamole !  the food came out and the was served with rice , a salad ( sort of italian dressing with feta and tomatoes ) and refried beans . the salad was pretty generic and the rice was bland , but the actual main courses were great and the refried beans helped with the spice ( i 'm a wimp ) .  the appetizer and our main courses came to $ 30 and we were very full .  service was good and food was good and it was n't too expensive . it was n't perfect , but we 'll totally be back !

DOC124 worst experience ever ! i had been there before to get my nails done and the first time was quite good , but the second time was a hot mess . it looked like a five year old did my nails for me . i went home and took the polish off . but this is the kicker : i could n't get an appointment for highlights at my regular salon and this was close by , so i decided to give it a try ( obviously the nail girl would n't be doing my hair ) . i went in and sat down the a woman with an eastern european accent came to talk with me . i showed her a picture of what i wanted and she showed me various hair dye samples ... .none of which looked like my picture , but i always assume the hair dressers know what 's best . now , you 're all thinking , `` ..and she did a poor job and you hated the colour ... '' right ? nope , she told me she could n't do my hair because i had lice ! of course i freaked out . another hair dresser came over to see if i was alright and i was mortified . she asked if i had experienced any itching . i said no . this hairdresser turned back to the original hairdresser and asked if maybe it was n't too bad yet , but original hairdresser said it was really , really bad . i freaked out and left ( obviously without having anything done ) and went to a shoppers and bought lice shampoo . i went home and had my husband look at my hair . he looked and looked and could find nothing . i still did n't want to take chances , so we tore the house apart and washed and bagged everything and i went to a walk-in clinic . the doctor looked at my head and also said there was nothing there ! since i was paranoid , i still used the shampoo and anytime my head itched in the slightest i went to examine it . but even with my husband and mother looking at my head , we never found a single thing . we did n't even see dandruff ! ! i went to a hairdresser a week later and they told me my hair was beautiful ... but dry at the ends ... yeah , because of the chemical-filled lice shampoo ! thanks a lot you crazy woman ! so ultimately , i never had lice . i do n't know if this woman just decided she did n't feel like doing my hair , or if she was delusional , but i sure wo n't be going back there ever again . no one else should either , unless you want to risk being embarrassed and inconvenienced .
DOC125 i love cupcakes . seriously ... .love affair ! so i 'm always on the lookout for new cupcake places . i was in scarborough town centre and came upon this kiosk . it 's not a storefront , but a rather ingenious booth , with colourful signs and a glass showcase full of cupcakes .  there is a long list of flavours and i suspect ( as with many places ) they make different cupcakes for different days .  i ordered 6 , which was $ 18 ... i know , it 's steep , that 's pretty standard . cupcake places seem to range from around the $ 2.25 mark to around $ 4\/cupcake . so these guys fall somewhere inbetween . but not cheap , so i expect excellence , needless to say .  now , here 's the strange thing . on their website each cupcake is listed as $ 2.90 ... .was this the case at the store ? ? i sure hope not . why would you have to pay more for buying more ? maybe it 's an ordering online thing ? anyway , my guess is that you 're paying $ 3\/cupcake at the store , or $ 18 for 6 . no real incentive to buy 6 . but i did , so moving on ... .  of course i chose a range of flavours : oreo cookie . chocolate with vanilla icing , salted caramel , lemon and a double chocolate .  over two days we managed to work our way through them ( myself and my husband ) and i nibbled the different flavours . lemon was my favorite , by far , with the salted caramel being a huge disappointment . it was entirely too salty . more salt than caramel . it was n't very good at all .  but that said , none of the cupcakes really blew me away . and in fact , they were very stale the next day , despite being stored in an airtight container , in the fridge . luckily , the cold buttercream frosting was easy to scoop off and once they had been in the oven for a few minutes , they softened up a bit .  the bottoms of the cupcakes stuck to the wrappers and the flavours were dull tasting and uninspired .  i was also surprised at the lack of creativity in terms of christmas flavours or designed . right before christmas you would expect some special flavours ... maybe a candy cane , or gingerbread cupcake . it would be so easy to switch out one flavour and try to get people to consider your product for a christmas party dessert .  having a little kiosk in a mall is a smart idea . sadly , this business is not one i think i will bother with again !
DOC126 i had a craving for mexican and came here ( ie . yelp ) to figure out what we could do , because there is a very real lack of good mexican food in toronto . this place had some good reviews and was n't too far away from us , so off we went .  parking in leaside can be pretty brutal , but we finally found a space and luckily , street parking is free .  the restaurant is tacky , stereotypical , but cozy and we were quickly greeted and seated .  the menu has basic mexican fare , burritos , fajitas , tacos , with your choice of meat . nothing too outside of the box , but that 's not necessarily a bad thing .  we ordered the guacamole to start and i ordered a chicken enchilada and my husband ordered the chimichanga .  the guacamole is very delicious and creamy , but we had to ask for more nachos and even then it felt like not enough . we were really loading up the chips with the guacamole !  the food came out and the was served with rice , a salad ( sort of italian dressing with feta and tomatoes ) and refried beans . the salad was pretty generic and the rice was bland , but the actual main courses were great and the refried beans helped with the spice ( i 'm a wimp ) .  the appetizer and our main courses came to $ 30 and we were very full .  service was good and food was good and it was n't too expensive . it was n't perfect , but we 'll totally be back !
DOC127 came here with my mother , husband and baby for brunch\/lunch . we were all quite happy with our choice . i think i was the `` winner '' by ordering the french toast . it was practically half a loaf of bread , covered with fruit and with delicious cinnamon butter . my husband ordered the stoney 's breakfast , which is your basic eggs , toast , bacon , etc , meal . my mother ordered the omelet . huge portions , but at around $ 11- $ 13 per breakfast meal , it was on the steep end of brunches and other than mine , i 'm not sure the price is warranted , especially since it 's a order at the counter , then find a seat with your number and wait for your meal type place . people were friendly and service was good ( for what it was ) . i would give it a try if i was in the area again .
DOC128 never eaten at this place before , but it 's always crowded and i decided that must mean something . i was running errands and had n't eaten the whole day , so decided to finally give this place a shot . i ordered a chicken sandwich and iced tea .  the iced tea does n't appear to be iced tea . it was a dark reddish colour and tasted like very watered down pomegranate juice . it was inedible . it was super gross . i was thinking that maybe they made a mistake , but i ca n't see on the menu anything else it might be and the girl who took my order , poured the drink and gave it to me said it was iced tea . sooooo ew .  sandwich was alright , but just alright . the `` aroma sauce '' which is a garlic mayo of sorts was good and the roasted red peppers and mozzerella on the sandwich were good . the bread was good , but the chicken was the sort of cheap , crappy chicken you find at subway , where it 's a sort of compressed chicken-like white meat , with fake grill marks on it . it had no taste and really took away from the overall sandwich .  there are soups , salads and of course hot beverages served at this place as well , so i 'm not writing it off just yet , but this was not a good first impression .
DOC129 solid soup place ... has an ever-so-slightly sketchy vibe to it ... you order your soup and the woman disappears into the back ... usually closes the sliding window so you ca n't see back there and then eventually emerges with your soup . also seems to sell a selection of jamaican movies in dvd from a glass case ... sort of random .  generous with the veggies , less so with dumplings , but all the soups have great flavour and are decently sized for the price . i wish they would offer some bread or crackers for the soup ... would be a nice , easy add-on . but this place is what it is and does n't bother with the bells and whistles . really deserves a 3.5 stars . the red bean is my fav by far .
DOC130 i would be more inclined to give this place 3-1\/2 stars , but since that 's not possible , i 'm rounding down .  i went here for sunday lunch with a group for winterlicious . for $ 15 we got a choice of appetizer , entree and dessert .  we arrived first and our table was waiting for us . the restaurant was not busy at that point and our waiter was very attentive with water and the wine menu .  once our party finally arrived we all ordered . i had their chipotle sweet potato & goat cheese dip , which was average . the salads looked much better and got better reviews . same with the soup . the dip was literally a dollap of dip at the side of the plate with some crostinis on the other end and 1 piece of pickled cauliflower and a few slices of onion in the middle . the dip was good , the pickled cauliflower alright . it was nice when all combined on the crostini ( pickled veggies , dip on top of crostini ) .  i had originally wanted to order the double pork slider , but i saw it arrive at someone else 's table and it was literally just the one , single mini pork sandwich , with a few thinly cut fries at the side . it looked good , but it was appetizer size , if that . the chicken sandwich was more reasonably sized , so i ordered that . it was good . i really liked the bread . the macaroni was also more reasonably sized . i sampled it and it was fine . did n't blow me away .  dessert was the highlight of the meal for everyone i think . some people ordered the mousse , which i thought was fine , but the people who ordered it loved , so there you have it . my husband loved his apple terrine , which i tried and was good . i liked the flavour of my creme brule very much , but the top was over toasted and had hardened to the consistency of a thin , hard candy . it was hard to break with my spoon and got stuck in my teeth .  the service was consistently good , so no complaints there . none of us had wine with our lunch ( although some had other drinks ) , so i ca n't comment there .  this is a tapas bar , so i expect sizes to be small . but when sizes are small i expect them to be priced accordingly and\/or to be in sharable portions . they gave the prices of each dish if you were to purchased them individually . these would all be hard to share and would n't really be worth it . they are nice as a winterlicious meal , but i 'm not sure this would be my first choice to go back to .
DOC131 i am surprised at the people complaining about the service , because we found the service to be fine . especially given how busy and cramped it was . there were no tables , but they got us seats at the bar . the music was maybe a little loud , but i enjoyed the 90s throwback that was happening . the place looks like a dive , it 's a total hole in the wall , with no signs to speak of , but i liked the weird atmosphere of weird , old `` ghetto blasters '' on the walls and pics of arnold in terminator . it 's random , just go with it ... but the food ... .oh the food ! we were told that the squash poutine was a must have , so i ordered that and the bulgogi cheese steak , while my friend ordered the poutine and the mackerel . the mackerel was served first . it arrived raw , on a platter and a torch was taken to it to sear the outside and that was it . my friend allowed me a bite and it was so fresh tasting , with a delicious marinade . next came by bulgogi sandwich . fresh , delicious bread and amazing bulgogi . was very pleased . finally the `` poutines '' arrived . i should say that it was not what we were expecting . i assumed it would be squash on top of fries . but in fact the squash was the fries . they were lightly fried and covered in a variety of sauce `` gravies '' and scallions and some other stuff that i could neither make out , nor even see clearly ( dim lighting ) . it does n't matter okay ... .this stuff was heaven ! both my friend and i took a bite and looked at each other ... and proclaimed our new favourite food . other people in our party got the wings , which looked amazing and they said they were and the loosey , which was also proclaimed as delicious . so basically there were no wrong moves . the drink menu was very adventurous ... more so than we were , because we did n't take the plunge , although it was fun sitting at the bar and watching the bartender creating them . and splitting the bill for my friend with two others ( her birthday ) , my two `` tapas '' and a generic alcoholic beverage came to just under $ 30 . the prices are extremely reasonable ... and honestly once you try this stuff ... i mean , i do n't want to give them any ideas , but i would have paid more for that fine , fine food . i will be back . need me some more of that poutine !
DOC132 our friends got the groupon for four people and took us along . i 'm very pleased we went ! having never had ethiopian food before , we were curious , but wary . the deal really helped us dive in . it included two appetizers , four main courses and two desserts . we started with two appetizers , one i was n't a huge fan of ( a `` salad '' with a strong vinegar taste and jalapenos , which i found too strong , although other people in my group really liked it ) . the other appetizer was similar to an indian samosa ( similar name too , but i ca n't remember exactly what it was called ) . they were stuff with lentils and had a flaky shell . they were delicious . but , their appetizers were only made for three people , so there were only three of them ! seems silly when you offer a four person deal . we each ordered a different main course and they brought them on one large platter , so we could all share . we ordered two vegetarian options , one of lentils and one of chickpeas and one of chicken and one of beef . basically , the meals are more sauces than anything and they are served with injera , which are sort of bland , cold , bread-like stuff , which comes rolled up . they 're nothing special , but they 're only used as a sort of utensil , because you use it to scoop up the food . the food was delicious ! i especially liked the chickpea dish . every one of us ended up liking a different dish the best ! worked out well . i personally found the beef dish very tough though . once we were stuff with the food , we ordered two desserts . we especially liked the cheesecake ( which is obviously not ethiopian ) . we asked if they had any ethiopian coffees and they said yes . they showed us the beans , as they were being roasted . then they came back out with a sort of stone earthenware kettle and some small cups . the coffee was so rich , it was almost like chocolate . they also served it with a large basket of popcorn , which was just perfectly prepared . it was such a nice after dinner snack ! i would totally come here just to order the coffee ! it would have been a very expensive dinner without the groupon , so i 'm not sure i would make this a regularly destination , but as i said , the coffee was fantastic and it 's a fun thing to try , especially with friends . make sure they 're good ones , that you do n't mind getting messy in front of !
DOC133 a little on the pricey end for baked goods , but the baked goods are good . also their coffee products are great . the set up is annoying ( order your desserts on one side and coffee and food on another side ) , but the service is good and overall they do a good job .
DOC134 my sister told me that origin was well known for their delicious brunches , so we made a trip there to see if this was the case . origin is pretty new in our area and is very large , but nicely decorated . my only comment would be the washrooms , which feature communal sinks , the kind you find in elementary schools , where you step on the thing at the bottom and water comes out all around . besides not being very effective to quickly wash hands , it 's also wasteful if you 're the only one there . strange concept . throw back , but not necessarily one wants to remember during their brunch . now onto the important part ... the food and service . service started out alright and then immediately got very slow . it took some time to get our drink orders and then took a long time to get our actual orders . i ordered their french toast , my sister ordered tostada and my husband skipped brunch and ordered a meal they offered of a burger , fries covered in some chorizo and sauce and a float . i also ordered a side of bacon ... and was told that they were out of bacon ... which meant any orders that would have come with bacon were out entirely , or would be served without bacon . i 'm sorry but a brunch restaurant without bacon ? even the waitress admitted it was ridiculous . we also shared a plate of buscuits with their preserves . these were delicious . apparently my meal was the one that took the longest . the others got their food and we still waited for five minutes before mine came out . who knew it would take so long to put a couple of pieces of bread on a plate and cover them with blueberry preserves ? my sister said her tostada was quite good . my french toast was nothing special . the toast was `` fancy '' , rounded pieces , on top of each other with whipped cream and blueberries in between . the `` maple '' which was supposed to be on the plate ( maple syrup i 'm guessing ) was barely present . tasted like something i could have created with some ease . my husband 's dish was the best by far . his burger was juicy and this fries were great . the float was a little silly ... this big , meaty burger and fries covered in more meat ... paired with a cream soda float in pink and white layers . ( not insulting , we just got a laugh ) . nothing was cheap and then we had to wait a long time again to get our bill and pay . this was all strange because the restaurant was not particularly busy . because the brunch itself did n't blow me away , food shortages and service , i 'm not sure if i would bother with brunch again . oliver and bonicini in the actual mall has a much better brunch . i might try this again for lunch or dinner though .
DOC135 the saga has finished ... .because i needed to end this bs and move on .  so first off , the store owner responded to my complaints ... by blaming me . apparently it is my fault they sent the wrong thing , because i sent an email and then followed it up with a phone call ... which confused them and made them think there were two orders or something . which makes zero sense , because two orders were not sent . and the person i was speaking with on the phone responded to the emails i sent with codes to try out ... .so i have a hard time believing that they were confused by what was going on and thought that the phone order and email order were different .  they also told me they blocked me on instagram because i was body shaming their models . i want to be very clear on this . i never once body shamed , or made any comments on instagram about their models . i asked why they were promoting clothing they do n't even have in stock on instagram ... apparently that equates to body shaming to them .  they also informed me that because they had to mail so many orders to me ( 3 ) , they were going to start to charge me for shipping . they seemed to forget that i had also been paying to ship items back to them and that i had specifically chosen times when they had free shipping promos taking place to place orders . it 's not that they were n't charging me for shipping ... it was that i was taking advantage of their own promos . apparently i ca n't use their promos anymore , because they have placed an arbitrary rules on how many times you can make a return now . at least for me .  they did not address the code not working .  i responded and expressed continued frustration at their lack of ownership over their mistakes and how poor their customer service continued to be .  then i did some research and sent another email . instead of returning the dress i would donate it to dress for success . i said this seemed like a better choice than continuing to mail clothing back and forth . my request to them was that they take the would be money they would spend on continuing to mail me clothing and take some ownership for their mistakes and channel it into something good . i asked that they take the remaining $ 9.98 credit i had and put it towards them making a small donation , either monetarily or a piece of clothing , also to the charity . i stated that their continued neglect for customer service and lack of ownership over repeated problems should be owned up to , but if they would n't do it for me , perhaps they would be willing to do so for someone in need . i said that would conclude our business and bring something good out of this ridiculousness .  a few hours later i received an email with a letter of thanks for a donation made to dress for success ... for the amount of $ 10 via the store ... .so my remainder amount i had paid for and big sis closet 's contribution of ... .two cents . their generosity is astounding . now , i do n't know that they have n't made their own donation and just not told me of course ... i 'll let you guys decide whether you want to give them the benefit of the doubt in that regard . but given that they have taken zero responsibility for the continued poor management and customer service , well ... i think you can guess what my thoughts are on the subject . no further correspondence was sent from the actual store .  but at any rate , i am donating the new dress to dress for success ( along with my $ 9.98 ) and i am officially done with this store for good . and i sincerely hope that people read this review and think twice about shopping here . the clothes are not good quality , but more than that ... i have never experienced such insanely bad management and customer service in my life . zero regard for their customers , zero regard for their own mistakes , zero regard for taking ownership of ... anything ! just excuse after excuse and then turning the blame around on their customers . these people do not deserve your business and quite frankly ... ladies you deserve better . better clothing ( i have now purchased 6 items and been dissatisfied with the quality of all of them ... loose threads , flimsy , cheap fabric , wrong stitching for the fabric , no lining , incorrect fit for size , etc . ) and a greater degree of respect as a consumer .
DOC136 went here with my sister and her boyfriend for some drinks . we were hungry and ordered a few appetizers to share . drinks were fine ( my mix drink was on the very small side ) , but the food was really good . the perogies and `` chips '' and dip were excellent . the service was good and the atmosphere was nice , for such a small place . bathrooms were also nice , clean , etc . only problem is that some of the tables are so small , it 's really hard to use them . we were at a very small one and even though we fit around it alright , a guy walking by knocked a beer over with his coat and it dumped all down me . i mean all over me . it 's not the bar 's fault the guy knocked the glass , but if the table was a bit bigger we would have had more room to put the glass further in , so it would n't have gotten knocked in the first place . the fact is , if you 're going to serve food people need a place to put it . a few slightly bigger tables would go a long way .
DOC121 after being scared away from rock & rita 's , we ended up at this place , which was , if nothing else , quieter .  i 'll start by saying that the hostess and our server were both lovely and they 're really what earned the single star , because they were sweet , but the food was just horrible .  i ordered a simple grilled cheese sandwich . i asked the server if it was processed cheese , or `` real '' cheese in the sandwich and he had no idea what i was talking about . i tried to clarify by saying , `` is it like kraft single slices , or deli cheese ? '' he said it was `` good '' . this really should have been a sign and i could probably fault the waiter for this , since you should know what you 're serving , but he was so sweet , i could n't be mad !  my husband ordered a hot dog of sorts .  i asked if there was a way to substitute fries for a salad . there was not , but the server hooked me up and brought me a salad anyway ( no charge ) . i asked for sweet potato fries with the sandwich .  of course , my sandwich was made with plasticy , processed cheese , that was melted to the point of cheeze-wiz and was inedible . i took one bite of the sandwich and could n't do another . i got regular fries , instead of sweet potato ( did n't bother complaining , because i got the free salad , so whatever ... like i said , nice server ! ) my husband 's food was fine , although nothing special . they were good with the refills of our drinks .  anyway , as nice as the servers were , it was n't good . i would avoid eating here if i could .

DOC128 never eaten at this place before , but it 's always crowded and i decided that must mean something . i was running errands and had n't eaten the whole day , so decided to finally give this place a shot . i ordered a chicken sandwich and iced tea .  the iced tea does n't appear to be iced tea . it was a dark reddish colour and tasted like very watered down pomegranate juice . it was inedible . it was super gross . i was thinking that maybe they made a mistake , but i ca n't see on the menu anything else it might be and the girl who took my order , poured the drink and gave it to me said it was iced tea . sooooo ew .  sandwich was alright , but just alright . the `` aroma sauce '' which is a garlic mayo of sorts was good and the roasted red peppers and mozzerella on the sandwich were good . the bread was good , but the chicken was the sort of cheap , crappy chicken you find at subway , where it 's a sort of compressed chicken-like white meat , with fake grill marks on it . it had no taste and really took away from the overall sandwich .  there are soups , salads and of course hot beverages served at this place as well , so i 'm not writing it off just yet , but this was not a good first impression .
DOC129 solid soup place ... has an ever-so-slightly sketchy vibe to it ... you order your soup and the woman disappears into the back ... usually closes the sliding window so you ca n't see back there and then eventually emerges with your soup . also seems to sell a selection of jamaican movies in dvd from a glass case ... sort of random .  generous with the veggies , less so with dumplings , but all the soups have great flavour and are decently sized for the price . i wish they would offer some bread or crackers for the soup ... would be a nice , easy add-on . but this place is what it is and does n't bother with the bells and whistles . really deserves a 3.5 stars . the red bean is my fav by far .
DOC130 i would be more inclined to give this place 3-1\/2 stars , but since that 's not possible , i 'm rounding down .  i went here for sunday lunch with a group for winterlicious . for $ 15 we got a choice of appetizer , entree and dessert .  we arrived first and our table was waiting for us . the restaurant was not busy at that point and our waiter was very attentive with water and the wine menu .  once our party finally arrived we all ordered . i had their chipotle sweet potato & goat cheese dip , which was average . the salads looked much better and got better reviews . same with the soup . the dip was literally a dollap of dip at the side of the plate with some crostinis on the other end and 1 piece of pickled cauliflower and a few slices of onion in the middle . the dip was good , the pickled cauliflower alright . it was nice when all combined on the crostini ( pickled veggies , dip on top of crostini ) .  i had originally wanted to order the double pork slider , but i saw it arrive at someone else 's table and it was literally just the one , single mini pork sandwich , with a few thinly cut fries at the side . it looked good , but it was appetizer size , if that . the chicken sandwich was more reasonably sized , so i ordered that . it was good . i really liked the bread . the macaroni was also more reasonably sized . i sampled it and it was fine . did n't blow me away .  dessert was the highlight of the meal for everyone i think . some people ordered the mousse , which i thought was fine , but the people who ordered it loved , so there you have it . my husband loved his apple terrine , which i tried and was good . i liked the flavour of my creme brule very much , but the top was over toasted and had hardened to the consistency of a thin , hard candy . it was hard to break with my spoon and got stuck in my teeth .  the service was consistently good , so no complaints there . none of us had wine with our lunch ( although some had other drinks ) , so i ca n't comment there .  this is a tapas bar , so i expect sizes to be small . but when sizes are small i expect them to be priced accordingly and\/or to be in sharable portions . they gave the prices of each dish if you were to purchased them individually . these would all be hard to share and would n't really be worth it . they are nice as a winterlicious meal , but i 'm not sure this would be my first choice to go back to .
DOC131 i am surprised at the people complaining about the service , because we found the service to be fine . especially given how busy and cramped it was . there were no tables , but they got us seats at the bar . the music was maybe a little loud , but i enjoyed the 90s throwback that was happening . the place looks like a dive , it 's a total hole in the wall , with no signs to speak of , but i liked the weird atmosphere of weird , old `` ghetto blasters '' on the walls and pics of arnold in terminator . it 's random , just go with it ... but the food ... .oh the food ! we were told that the squash poutine was a must have , so i ordered that and the bulgogi cheese steak , while my friend ordered the poutine and the mackerel . the mackerel was served first . it arrived raw , on a platter and a torch was taken to it to sear the outside and that was it . my friend allowed me a bite and it was so fresh tasting , with a delicious marinade . next came by bulgogi sandwich . fresh , delicious bread and amazing bulgogi . was very pleased . finally the `` poutines '' arrived . i should say that it was not what we were expecting . i assumed it would be squash on top of fries . but in fact the squash was the fries . they were lightly fried and covered in a variety of sauce `` gravies '' and scallions and some other stuff that i could neither make out , nor even see clearly ( dim lighting ) . it does n't matter okay ... .this stuff was heaven ! both my friend and i took a bite and looked at each other ... and proclaimed our new favourite food . other people in our party got the wings , which looked amazing and they said they were and the loosey , which was also proclaimed as delicious . so basically there were no wrong moves . the drink menu was very adventurous ... more so than we were , because we did n't take the plunge , although it was fun sitting at the bar and watching the bartender creating them . and splitting the bill for my friend with two others ( her birthday ) , my two `` tapas '' and a generic alcoholic beverage came to just under $ 30 . the prices are extremely reasonable ... and honestly once you try this stuff ... i mean , i do n't want to give them any ideas , but i would have paid more for that fine , fine food . i will be back . need me some more of that poutine !
DOC132 our friends got the groupon for four people and took us along . i 'm very pleased we went ! having never had ethiopian food before , we were curious , but wary . the deal really helped us dive in . it included two appetizers , four main courses and two desserts . we started with two appetizers , one i was n't a huge fan of ( a `` salad '' with a strong vinegar taste and jalapenos , which i found too strong , although other people in my group really liked it ) . the other appetizer was similar to an indian samosa ( similar name too , but i ca n't remember exactly what it was called ) . they were stuff with lentils and had a flaky shell . they were delicious . but , their appetizers were only made for three people , so there were only three of them ! seems silly when you offer a four person deal . we each ordered a different main course and they brought them on one large platter , so we could all share . we ordered two vegetarian options , one of lentils and one of chickpeas and one of chicken and one of beef . basically , the meals are more sauces than anything and they are served with injera , which are sort of bland , cold , bread-like stuff , which comes rolled up . they 're nothing special , but they 're only used as a sort of utensil , because you use it to scoop up the food . the food was delicious ! i especially liked the chickpea dish . every one of us ended up liking a different dish the best ! worked out well . i personally found the beef dish very tough though . once we were stuff with the food , we ordered two desserts . we especially liked the cheesecake ( which is obviously not ethiopian ) . we asked if they had any ethiopian coffees and they said yes . they showed us the beans , as they were being roasted . then they came back out with a sort of stone earthenware kettle and some small cups . the coffee was so rich , it was almost like chocolate . they also served it with a large basket of popcorn , which was just perfectly prepared . it was such a nice after dinner snack ! i would totally come here just to order the coffee ! it would have been a very expensive dinner without the groupon , so i 'm not sure i would make this a regularly destination , but as i said , the coffee was fantastic and it 's a fun thing to try , especially with friends . make sure they 're good ones , that you do n't mind getting messy in front of !
DOC133 a little on the pricey end for baked goods , but the baked goods are good . also their coffee products are great . the set up is annoying ( order your desserts on one side and coffee and food on another side ) , but the service is good and overall they do a good job .
DOC134 my sister told me that origin was well known for their delicious brunches , so we made a trip there to see if this was the case . origin is pretty new in our area and is very large , but nicely decorated . my only comment would be the washrooms , which feature communal sinks , the kind you find in elementary schools , where you step on the thing at the bottom and water comes out all around . besides not being very effective to quickly wash hands , it 's also wasteful if you 're the only one there . strange concept . throw back , but not necessarily one wants to remember during their brunch . now onto the important part ... the food and service . service started out alright and then immediately got very slow . it took some time to get our drink orders and then took a long time to get our actual orders . i ordered their french toast , my sister ordered tostada and my husband skipped brunch and ordered a meal they offered of a burger , fries covered in some chorizo and sauce and a float . i also ordered a side of bacon ... and was told that they were out of bacon ... which meant any orders that would have come with bacon were out entirely , or would be served without bacon . i 'm sorry but a brunch restaurant without bacon ? even the waitress admitted it was ridiculous . we also shared a plate of buscuits with their preserves . these were delicious . apparently my meal was the one that took the longest . the others got their food and we still waited for five minutes before mine came out . who knew it would take so long to put a couple of pieces of bread on a plate and cover them with blueberry preserves ? my sister said her tostada was quite good . my french toast was nothing special . the toast was `` fancy '' , rounded pieces , on top of each other with whipped cream and blueberries in between . the `` maple '' which was supposed to be on the plate ( maple syrup i 'm guessing ) was barely present . tasted like something i could have created with some ease . my husband 's dish was the best by far . his burger was juicy and this fries were great . the float was a little silly ... this big , meaty burger and fries covered in more meat ... paired with a cream soda float in pink and white layers . ( not insulting , we just got a laugh ) . nothing was cheap and then we had to wait a long time again to get our bill and pay . this was all strange because the restaurant was not particularly busy . because the brunch itself did n't blow me away , food shortages and service , i 'm not sure if i would bother with brunch again . oliver and bonicini in the actual mall has a much better brunch . i might try this again for lunch or dinner though .
DOC135 the saga has finished ... .because i needed to end this bs and move on .  so first off , the store owner responded to my complaints ... by blaming me . apparently it is my fault they sent the wrong thing , because i sent an email and then followed it up with a phone call ... which confused them and made them think there were two orders or something . which makes zero sense , because two orders were not sent . and the person i was speaking with on the phone responded to the emails i sent with codes to try out ... .so i have a hard time believing that they were confused by what was going on and thought that the phone order and email order were different .  they also told me they blocked me on instagram because i was body shaming their models . i want to be very clear on this . i never once body shamed , or made any comments on instagram about their models . i asked why they were promoting clothing they do n't even have in stock on instagram ... apparently that equates to body shaming to them .  they also informed me that because they had to mail so many orders to me ( 3 ) , they were going to start to charge me for shipping . they seemed to forget that i had also been paying to ship items back to them and that i had specifically chosen times when they had free shipping promos taking place to place orders . it 's not that they were n't charging me for shipping ... it was that i was taking advantage of their own promos . apparently i ca n't use their promos anymore , because they have placed an arbitrary rules on how many times you can make a return now . at least for me .  they did not address the code not working .  i responded and expressed continued frustration at their lack of ownership over their mistakes and how poor their customer service continued to be .  then i did some research and sent another email . instead of returning the dress i would donate it to dress for success . i said this seemed like a better choice than continuing to mail clothing back and forth . my request to them was that they take the would be money they would spend on continuing to mail me clothing and take some ownership for their mistakes and channel it into something good . i asked that they take the remaining $ 9.98 credit i had and put it towards them making a small donation , either monetarily or a piece of clothing , also to the charity . i stated that their continued neglect for customer service and lack of ownership over repeated problems should be owned up to , but if they would n't do it for me , perhaps they would be willing to do so for someone in need . i said that would conclude our business and bring something good out of this ridiculousness .  a few hours later i received an email with a letter of thanks for a donation made to dress for success ... for the amount of $ 10 via the store ... .so my remainder amount i had paid for and big sis closet 's contribution of ... .two cents . their generosity is astounding . now , i do n't know that they have n't made their own donation and just not told me of course ... i 'll let you guys decide whether you want to give them the benefit of the doubt in that regard . but given that they have taken zero responsibility for the continued poor management and customer service , well ... i think you can guess what my thoughts are on the subject . no further correspondence was sent from the actual store .  but at any rate , i am donating the new dress to dress for success ( along with my $ 9.98 ) and i am officially done with this store for good . and i sincerely hope that people read this review and think twice about shopping here . the clothes are not good quality , but more than that ... i have never experienced such insanely bad management and customer service in my life . zero regard for their customers , zero regard for their own mistakes , zero regard for taking ownership of ... anything ! just excuse after excuse and then turning the blame around on their customers . these people do not deserve your business and quite frankly ... ladies you deserve better . better clothing ( i have now purchased 6 items and been dissatisfied with the quality of all of them ... loose threads , flimsy , cheap fabric , wrong stitching for the fabric , no lining , incorrect fit for size , etc . ) and a greater degree of respect as a consumer .
DOC136 went here with my sister and her boyfriend for some drinks . we were hungry and ordered a few appetizers to share . drinks were fine ( my mix drink was on the very small side ) , but the food was really good . the perogies and `` chips '' and dip were excellent . the service was good and the atmosphere was nice , for such a small place . bathrooms were also nice , clean , etc . only problem is that some of the tables are so small , it 's really hard to use them . we were at a very small one and even though we fit around it alright , a guy walking by knocked a beer over with his coat and it dumped all down me . i mean all over me . it 's not the bar 's fault the guy knocked the glass , but if the table was a bit bigger we would have had more room to put the glass further in , so it would n't have gotten knocked in the first place . the fact is , if you 're going to serve food people need a place to put it . a few slightly bigger tables would go a long way .
DOC121 after being scared away from rock & rita 's , we ended up at this place , which was , if nothing else , quieter .  i 'll start by saying that the hostess and our server were both lovely and they 're really what earned the single star , because they were sweet , but the food was just horrible .  i ordered a simple grilled cheese sandwich . i asked the server if it was processed cheese , or `` real '' cheese in the sandwich and he had no idea what i was talking about . i tried to clarify by saying , `` is it like kraft single slices , or deli cheese ? '' he said it was `` good '' . this really should have been a sign and i could probably fault the waiter for this , since you should know what you 're serving , but he was so sweet , i could n't be mad !  my husband ordered a hot dog of sorts .  i asked if there was a way to substitute fries for a salad . there was not , but the server hooked me up and brought me a salad anyway ( no charge ) . i asked for sweet potato fries with the sandwich .  of course , my sandwich was made with plasticy , processed cheese , that was melted to the point of cheeze-wiz and was inedible . i took one bite of the sandwich and could n't do another . i got regular fries , instead of sweet potato ( did n't bother complaining , because i got the free salad , so whatever ... like i said , nice server ! ) my husband 's food was fine , although nothing special . they were good with the refills of our drinks .  anyway , as nice as the servers were , it was n't good . i would avoid eating here if i could .
DOC122 we got recommendations for this place from my parents and so , for our anniversary , we booked here . we were told though that it was first come , first served , in terms of having the ideal seats by the windows that overlook the fountains of the bellagio and the strip . we went for lunch though , so it was n't too busy . we were seated by the window and were promptly served some sort of puffed rolls , with cheese and herbs infused . they were delicious !  we ordered the onion soup to start and i ordered parmesan chicken and my husband ordered a lamb burger . our food came and was delicious . the soup was probably my favorite part . we were feeling very full by the end and so declined dessert , but were still given some jellies and chocolate truffle and then were served a small chocolate mousse , on a decorated plate that said happy anniversary , which was a total surprise ( they had asked when i booked if it was a special occasion , but had said nothing while we were there ) . overall the service was great , the food delicious and the view wonderful . it was a great experience !
DOC123 i went here for the first time yesterday night to celebrate something with my family . several members of my family have been to this place before for summerlicious and really enjoyed it .  a nice atmosphere and excellent service , everyone ordered a variety of different dishes , many of which i tasted . i myself had a chicken salad and thought it was very good . my sister 's pasta dish was amazing though ! our waiter never rushed us out and was quick to refill water and bread and clear dishes , etc . that with an arm brace on !  prices are a little high , which is why i did n't give this place five stars ... i know those amazing places exist out there with great food and great prices , but this was a nice evening out .
DOC124 worst experience ever ! i had been there before to get my nails done and the first time was quite good , but the second time was a hot mess . it looked like a five year old did my nails for me . i went home and took the polish off . but this is the kicker : i could n't get an appointment for highlights at my regular salon and this was close by , so i decided to give it a try ( obviously the nail girl would n't be doing my hair ) . i went in and sat down the a woman with an eastern european accent came to talk with me . i showed her a picture of what i wanted and she showed me various hair dye samples ... .none of which looked like my picture , but i always assume the hair dressers know what 's best . now , you 're all thinking , `` ..and she did a poor job and you hated the colour ... '' right ? nope , she told me she could n't do my hair because i had lice ! of course i freaked out . another hair dresser came over to see if i was alright and i was mortified . she asked if i had experienced any itching . i said no . this hairdresser turned back to the original hairdresser and asked if maybe it was n't too bad yet , but original hairdresser said it was really , really bad . i freaked out and left ( obviously without having anything done ) and went to a shoppers and bought lice shampoo . i went home and had my husband look at my hair . he looked and looked and could find nothing . i still did n't want to take chances , so we tore the house apart and washed and bagged everything and i went to a walk-in clinic . the doctor looked at my head and also said there was nothing there ! since i was paranoid , i still used the shampoo and anytime my head itched in the slightest i went to examine it . but even with my husband and mother looking at my head , we never found a single thing . we did n't even see dandruff ! ! i went to a hairdresser a week later and they told me my hair was beautiful ... but dry at the ends ... yeah , because of the chemical-filled lice shampoo ! thanks a lot you crazy woman ! so ultimately , i never had lice . i do n't know if this woman just decided she did n't feel like doing my hair , or if she was delusional , but i sure wo n't be going back there ever again . no one else should either , unless you want to risk being embarrassed and inconvenienced .
DOC125 i love cupcakes . seriously ... .love affair ! so i 'm always on the lookout for new cupcake places . i was in scarborough town centre and came upon this kiosk . it 's not a storefront , but a rather ingenious booth , with colourful signs and a glass showcase full of cupcakes .  there is a long list of flavours and i suspect ( as with many places ) they make different cupcakes for different days .  i ordered 6 , which was $ 18 ... i know , it 's steep , that 's pretty standard . cupcake places seem to range from around the $ 2.25 mark to around $ 4\/cupcake . so these guys fall somewhere inbetween . but not cheap , so i expect excellence , needless to say .  now , here 's the strange thing . on their website each cupcake is listed as $ 2.90 ... .was this the case at the store ? ? i sure hope not . why would you have to pay more for buying more ? maybe it 's an ordering online thing ? anyway , my guess is that you 're paying $ 3\/cupcake at the store , or $ 18 for 6 . no real incentive to buy 6 . but i did , so moving on ... .  of course i chose a range of flavours : oreo cookie . chocolate with vanilla icing , salted caramel , lemon and a double chocolate .  over two days we managed to work our way through them ( myself and my husband ) and i nibbled the different flavours . lemon was my favorite , by far , with the salted caramel being a huge disappointment . it was entirely too salty . more salt than caramel . it was n't very good at all .  but that said , none of the cupcakes really blew me away . and in fact , they were very stale the next day , despite being stored in an airtight container , in the fridge . luckily , the cold buttercream frosting was easy to scoop off and once they had been in the oven for a few minutes , they softened up a bit .  the bottoms of the cupcakes stuck to the wrappers and the flavours were dull tasting and uninspired .  i was also surprised at the lack of creativity in terms of christmas flavours or designed . right before christmas you would expect some special flavours ... maybe a candy cane , or gingerbread cupcake . it would be so easy to switch out one flavour and try to get people to consider your product for a christmas party dessert .  having a little kiosk in a mall is a smart idea . sadly , this business is not one i think i will bother with again !

DOC122 we got recommendations for this place from my parents and so , for our anniversary , we booked here . we were told though that it was first come , first served , in terms of having the ideal seats by the windows that overlook the fountains of the bellagio and the strip . we went for lunch though , so it was n't too busy . we were seated by the window and were promptly served some sort of puffed rolls , with cheese and herbs infused . they were delicious !  we ordered the onion soup to start and i ordered parmesan chicken and my husband ordered a lamb burger . our food came and was delicious . the soup was probably my favorite part . we were feeling very full by the end and so declined dessert , but were still given some jellies and chocolate truffle and then were served a small chocolate mousse , on a decorated plate that said happy anniversary , which was a total surprise ( they had asked when i booked if it was a special occasion , but had said nothing while we were there ) . overall the service was great , the food delicious and the view wonderful . it was a great experience !
DOC123 i went here for the first time yesterday night to celebrate something with my family . several members of my family have been to this place before for summerlicious and really enjoyed it .  a nice atmosphere and excellent service , everyone ordered a variety of different dishes , many of which i tasted . i myself had a chicken salad and thought it was very good . my sister 's pasta dish was amazing though ! our waiter never rushed us out and was quick to refill water and bread and clear dishes , etc . that with an arm brace on !  prices are a little high , which is why i did n't give this place five stars ... i know those amazing places exist out there with great food and great prices , but this was a nice evening out .
DOC124 worst experience ever ! i had been there before to get my nails done and the first time was quite good , but the second time was a hot mess . it looked like a five year old did my nails for me . i went home and took the polish off . but this is the kicker : i could n't get an appointment for highlights at my regular salon and this was close by , so i decided to give it a try ( obviously the nail girl would n't be doing my hair ) . i went in and sat down the a woman with an eastern european accent came to talk with me . i showed her a picture of what i wanted and she showed me various hair dye samples ... .none of which looked like my picture , but i always assume the hair dressers know what 's best . now , you 're all thinking , `` ..and she did a poor job and you hated the colour ... '' right ? nope , she told me she could n't do my hair because i had lice ! of course i freaked out . another hair dresser came over to see if i was alright and i was mortified . she asked if i had experienced any itching . i said no . this hairdresser turned back to the original hairdresser and asked if maybe it was n't too bad yet , but original hairdresser said it was really , really bad . i freaked out and left ( obviously without having anything done ) and went to a shoppers and bought lice shampoo . i went home and had my husband look at my hair . he looked and looked and could find nothing . i still did n't want to take chances , so we tore the house apart and washed and bagged everything and i went to a walk-in clinic . the doctor looked at my head and also said there was nothing there ! since i was paranoid , i still used the shampoo and anytime my head itched in the slightest i went to examine it . but even with my husband and mother looking at my head , we never found a single thing . we did n't even see dandruff ! ! i went to a hairdresser a week later and they told me my hair was beautiful ... but dry at the ends ... yeah , because of the chemical-filled lice shampoo ! thanks a lot you crazy woman ! so ultimately , i never had lice . i do n't know if this woman just decided she did n't feel like doing my hair , or if she was delusional , but i sure wo n't be going back there ever again . no one else should either , unless you want to risk being embarrassed and inconvenienced .
DOC125 i love cupcakes . seriously ... .love affair ! so i 'm always on the lookout for new cupcake places . i was in scarborough town centre and came upon this kiosk . it 's not a storefront , but a rather ingenious booth , with colourful signs and a glass showcase full of cupcakes .  there is a long list of flavours and i suspect ( as with many places ) they make different cupcakes for different days .  i ordered 6 , which was $ 18 ... i know , it 's steep , that 's pretty standard . cupcake places seem to range from around the $ 2.25 mark to around $ 4\/cupcake . so these guys fall somewhere inbetween . but not cheap , so i expect excellence , needless to say .  now , here 's the strange thing . on their website each cupcake is listed as $ 2.90 ... .was this the case at the store ? ? i sure hope not . why would you have to pay more for buying more ? maybe it 's an ordering online thing ? anyway , my guess is that you 're paying $ 3\/cupcake at the store , or $ 18 for 6 . no real incentive to buy 6 . but i did , so moving on ... .  of course i chose a range of flavours : oreo cookie . chocolate with vanilla icing , salted caramel , lemon and a double chocolate .  over two days we managed to work our way through them ( myself and my husband ) and i nibbled the different flavours . lemon was my favorite , by far , with the salted caramel being a huge disappointment . it was entirely too salty . more salt than caramel . it was n't very good at all .  but that said , none of the cupcakes really blew me away . and in fact , they were very stale the next day , despite being stored in an airtight container , in the fridge . luckily , the cold buttercream frosting was easy to scoop off and once they had been in the oven for a few minutes , they softened up a bit .  the bottoms of the cupcakes stuck to the wrappers and the flavours were dull tasting and uninspired .  i was also surprised at the lack of creativity in terms of christmas flavours or designed . right before christmas you would expect some special flavours ... maybe a candy cane , or gingerbread cupcake . it would be so easy to switch out one flavour and try to get people to consider your product for a christmas party dessert .  having a little kiosk in a mall is a smart idea . sadly , this business is not one i think i will bother with again !
DOC126 i had a craving for mexican and came here ( ie . yelp ) to figure out what we could do , because there is a very real lack of good mexican food in toronto . this place had some good reviews and was n't too far away from us , so off we went .  parking in leaside can be pretty brutal , but we finally found a space and luckily , street parking is free .  the restaurant is tacky , stereotypical , but cozy and we were quickly greeted and seated .  the menu has basic mexican fare , burritos , fajitas , tacos , with your choice of meat . nothing too outside of the box , but that 's not necessarily a bad thing .  we ordered the guacamole to start and i ordered a chicken enchilada and my husband ordered the chimichanga .  the guacamole is very delicious and creamy , but we had to ask for more nachos and even then it felt like not enough . we were really loading up the chips with the guacamole !  the food came out and the was served with rice , a salad ( sort of italian dressing with feta and tomatoes ) and refried beans . the salad was pretty generic and the rice was bland , but the actual main courses were great and the refried beans helped with the spice ( i 'm a wimp ) .  the appetizer and our main courses came to $ 30 and we were very full .  service was good and food was good and it was n't too expensive . it was n't perfect , but we 'll totally be back !
DOC127 came here with my mother , husband and baby for brunch\/lunch . we were all quite happy with our choice . i think i was the `` winner '' by ordering the french toast . it was practically half a loaf of bread , covered with fruit and with delicious cinnamon butter . my husband ordered the stoney 's breakfast , which is your basic eggs , toast , bacon , etc , meal . my mother ordered the omelet . huge portions , but at around $ 11- $ 13 per breakfast meal , it was on the steep end of brunches and other than mine , i 'm not sure the price is warranted , especially since it 's a order at the counter , then find a seat with your number and wait for your meal type place . people were friendly and service was good ( for what it was ) . i would give it a try if i was in the area again .
DOC128 never eaten at this place before , but it 's always crowded and i decided that must mean something . i was running errands and had n't eaten the whole day , so decided to finally give this place a shot . i ordered a chicken sandwich and iced tea .  the iced tea does n't appear to be iced tea . it was a dark reddish colour and tasted like very watered down pomegranate juice . it was inedible . it was super gross . i was thinking that maybe they made a mistake , but i ca n't see on the menu anything else it might be and the girl who took my order , poured the drink and gave it to me said it was iced tea . sooooo ew .  sandwich was alright , but just alright . the `` aroma sauce '' which is a garlic mayo of sorts was good and the roasted red peppers and mozzerella on the sandwich were good . the bread was good , but the chicken was the sort of cheap , crappy chicken you find at subway , where it 's a sort of compressed chicken-like white meat , with fake grill marks on it . it had no taste and really took away from the overall sandwich .  there are soups , salads and of course hot beverages served at this place as well , so i 'm not writing it off just yet , but this was not a good first impression .
DOC129 solid soup place ... has an ever-so-slightly sketchy vibe to it ... you order your soup and the woman disappears into the back ... usually closes the sliding window so you ca n't see back there and then eventually emerges with your soup . also seems to sell a selection of jamaican movies in dvd from a glass case ... sort of random .  generous with the veggies , less so with dumplings , but all the soups have great flavour and are decently sized for the price . i wish they would offer some bread or crackers for the soup ... would be a nice , easy add-on . but this place is what it is and does n't bother with the bells and whistles . really deserves a 3.5 stars . the red bean is my fav by far .
DOC130 i would be more inclined to give this place 3-1\/2 stars , but since that 's not possible , i 'm rounding down .  i went here for sunday lunch with a group for winterlicious . for $ 15 we got a choice of appetizer , entree and dessert .  we arrived first and our table was waiting for us . the restaurant was not busy at that point and our waiter was very attentive with water and the wine menu .  once our party finally arrived we all ordered . i had their chipotle sweet potato & goat cheese dip , which was average . the salads looked much better and got better reviews . same with the soup . the dip was literally a dollap of dip at the side of the plate with some crostinis on the other end and 1 piece of pickled cauliflower and a few slices of onion in the middle . the dip was good , the pickled cauliflower alright . it was nice when all combined on the crostini ( pickled veggies , dip on top of crostini ) .  i had originally wanted to order the double pork slider , but i saw it arrive at someone else 's table and it was literally just the one , single mini pork sandwich , with a few thinly cut fries at the side . it looked good , but it was appetizer size , if that . the chicken sandwich was more reasonably sized , so i ordered that . it was good . i really liked the bread . the macaroni was also more reasonably sized . i sampled it and it was fine . did n't blow me away .  dessert was the highlight of the meal for everyone i think . some people ordered the mousse , which i thought was fine , but the people who ordered it loved , so there you have it . my husband loved his apple terrine , which i tried and was good . i liked the flavour of my creme brule very much , but the top was over toasted and had hardened to the consistency of a thin , hard candy . it was hard to break with my spoon and got stuck in my teeth .  the service was consistently good , so no complaints there . none of us had wine with our lunch ( although some had other drinks ) , so i ca n't comment there .  this is a tapas bar , so i expect sizes to be small . but when sizes are small i expect them to be priced accordingly and\/or to be in sharable portions . they gave the prices of each dish if you were to purchased them individually . these would all be hard to share and would n't really be worth it . they are nice as a winterlicious meal , but i 'm not sure this would be my first choice to go back to .
DOC131 i am surprised at the people complaining about the service , because we found the service to be fine . especially given how busy and cramped it was . there were no tables , but they got us seats at the bar . the music was maybe a little loud , but i enjoyed the 90s throwback that was happening . the place looks like a dive , it 's a total hole in the wall , with no signs to speak of , but i liked the weird atmosphere of weird , old `` ghetto blasters '' on the walls and pics of arnold in terminator . it 's random , just go with it ... but the food ... .oh the food ! we were told that the squash poutine was a must have , so i ordered that and the bulgogi cheese steak , while my friend ordered the poutine and the mackerel . the mackerel was served first . it arrived raw , on a platter and a torch was taken to it to sear the outside and that was it . my friend allowed me a bite and it was so fresh tasting , with a delicious marinade . next came by bulgogi sandwich . fresh , delicious bread and amazing bulgogi . was very pleased . finally the `` poutines '' arrived . i should say that it was not what we were expecting . i assumed it would be squash on top of fries . but in fact the squash was the fries . they were lightly fried and covered in a variety of sauce `` gravies '' and scallions and some other stuff that i could neither make out , nor even see clearly ( dim lighting ) . it does n't matter okay ... .this stuff was heaven ! both my friend and i took a bite and looked at each other ... and proclaimed our new favourite food . other people in our party got the wings , which looked amazing and they said they were and the loosey , which was also proclaimed as delicious . so basically there were no wrong moves . the drink menu was very adventurous ... more so than we were , because we did n't take the plunge , although it was fun sitting at the bar and watching the bartender creating them . and splitting the bill for my friend with two others ( her birthday ) , my two `` tapas '' and a generic alcoholic beverage came to just under $ 30 . the prices are extremely reasonable ... and honestly once you try this stuff ... i mean , i do n't want to give them any ideas , but i would have paid more for that fine , fine food . i will be back . need me some more of that poutine !
DOC132 our friends got the groupon for four people and took us along . i 'm very pleased we went ! having never had ethiopian food before , we were curious , but wary . the deal really helped us dive in . it included two appetizers , four main courses and two desserts . we started with two appetizers , one i was n't a huge fan of ( a `` salad '' with a strong vinegar taste and jalapenos , which i found too strong , although other people in my group really liked it ) . the other appetizer was similar to an indian samosa ( similar name too , but i ca n't remember exactly what it was called ) . they were stuff with lentils and had a flaky shell . they were delicious . but , their appetizers were only made for three people , so there were only three of them ! seems silly when you offer a four person deal . we each ordered a different main course and they brought them on one large platter , so we could all share . we ordered two vegetarian options , one of lentils and one of chickpeas and one of chicken and one of beef . basically , the meals are more sauces than anything and they are served with injera , which are sort of bland , cold , bread-like stuff , which comes rolled up . they 're nothing special , but they 're only used as a sort of utensil , because you use it to scoop up the food . the food was delicious ! i especially liked the chickpea dish . every one of us ended up liking a different dish the best ! worked out well . i personally found the beef dish very tough though . once we were stuff with the food , we ordered two desserts . we especially liked the cheesecake ( which is obviously not ethiopian ) . we asked if they had any ethiopian coffees and they said yes . they showed us the beans , as they were being roasted . then they came back out with a sort of stone earthenware kettle and some small cups . the coffee was so rich , it was almost like chocolate . they also served it with a large basket of popcorn , which was just perfectly prepared . it was such a nice after dinner snack ! i would totally come here just to order the coffee ! it would have been a very expensive dinner without the groupon , so i 'm not sure i would make this a regularly destination , but as i said , the coffee was fantastic and it 's a fun thing to try , especially with friends . make sure they 're good ones , that you do n't mind getting messy in front of !
DOC133 a little on the pricey end for baked goods , but the baked goods are good . also their coffee products are great . the set up is annoying ( order your desserts on one side and coffee and food on another side ) , but the service is good and overall they do a good job .
DOC134 my sister told me that origin was well known for their delicious brunches , so we made a trip there to see if this was the case . origin is pretty new in our area and is very large , but nicely decorated . my only comment would be the washrooms , which feature communal sinks , the kind you find in elementary schools , where you step on the thing at the bottom and water comes out all around . besides not being very effective to quickly wash hands , it 's also wasteful if you 're the only one there . strange concept . throw back , but not necessarily one wants to remember during their brunch . now onto the important part ... the food and service . service started out alright and then immediately got very slow . it took some time to get our drink orders and then took a long time to get our actual orders . i ordered their french toast , my sister ordered tostada and my husband skipped brunch and ordered a meal they offered of a burger , fries covered in some chorizo and sauce and a float . i also ordered a side of bacon ... and was told that they were out of bacon ... which meant any orders that would have come with bacon were out entirely , or would be served without bacon . i 'm sorry but a brunch restaurant without bacon ? even the waitress admitted it was ridiculous . we also shared a plate of buscuits with their preserves . these were delicious . apparently my meal was the one that took the longest . the others got their food and we still waited for five minutes before mine came out . who knew it would take so long to put a couple of pieces of bread on a plate and cover them with blueberry preserves ? my sister said her tostada was quite good . my french toast was nothing special . the toast was `` fancy '' , rounded pieces , on top of each other with whipped cream and blueberries in between . the `` maple '' which was supposed to be on the plate ( maple syrup i 'm guessing ) was barely present . tasted like something i could have created with some ease . my husband 's dish was the best by far . his burger was juicy and this fries were great . the float was a little silly ... this big , meaty burger and fries covered in more meat ... paired with a cream soda float in pink and white layers . ( not insulting , we just got a laugh ) . nothing was cheap and then we had to wait a long time again to get our bill and pay . this was all strange because the restaurant was not particularly busy . because the brunch itself did n't blow me away , food shortages and service , i 'm not sure if i would bother with brunch again . oliver and bonicini in the actual mall has a much better brunch . i might try this again for lunch or dinner though .
DOC135 the saga has finished ... .because i needed to end this bs and move on .  so first off , the store owner responded to my complaints ... by blaming me . apparently it is my fault they sent the wrong thing , because i sent an email and then followed it up with a phone call ... which confused them and made them think there were two orders or something . which makes zero sense , because two orders were not sent . and the person i was speaking with on the phone responded to the emails i sent with codes to try out ... .so i have a hard time believing that they were confused by what was going on and thought that the phone order and email order were different .  they also told me they blocked me on instagram because i was body shaming their models . i want to be very clear on this . i never once body shamed , or made any comments on instagram about their models . i asked why they were promoting clothing they do n't even have in stock on instagram ... apparently that equates to body shaming to them .  they also informed me that because they had to mail so many orders to me ( 3 ) , they were going to start to charge me for shipping . they seemed to forget that i had also been paying to ship items back to them and that i had specifically chosen times when they had free shipping promos taking place to place orders . it 's not that they were n't charging me for shipping ... it was that i was taking advantage of their own promos . apparently i ca n't use their promos anymore , because they have placed an arbitrary rules on how many times you can make a return now . at least for me .  they did not address the code not working .  i responded and expressed continued frustration at their lack of ownership over their mistakes and how poor their customer service continued to be .  then i did some research and sent another email . instead of returning the dress i would donate it to dress for success . i said this seemed like a better choice than continuing to mail clothing back and forth . my request to them was that they take the would be money they would spend on continuing to mail me clothing and take some ownership for their mistakes and channel it into something good . i asked that they take the remaining $ 9.98 credit i had and put it towards them making a small donation , either monetarily or a piece of clothing , also to the charity . i stated that their continued neglect for customer service and lack of ownership over repeated problems should be owned up to , but if they would n't do it for me , perhaps they would be willing to do so for someone in need . i said that would conclude our business and bring something good out of this ridiculousness .  a few hours later i received an email with a letter of thanks for a donation made to dress for success ... for the amount of $ 10 via the store ... .so my remainder amount i had paid for and big sis closet 's contribution of ... .two cents . their generosity is astounding . now , i do n't know that they have n't made their own donation and just not told me of course ... i 'll let you guys decide whether you want to give them the benefit of the doubt in that regard . but given that they have taken zero responsibility for the continued poor management and customer service , well ... i think you can guess what my thoughts are on the subject . no further correspondence was sent from the actual store .  but at any rate , i am donating the new dress to dress for success ( along with my $ 9.98 ) and i am officially done with this store for good . and i sincerely hope that people read this review and think twice about shopping here . the clothes are not good quality , but more than that ... i have never experienced such insanely bad management and customer service in my life . zero regard for their customers , zero regard for their own mistakes , zero regard for taking ownership of ... anything ! just excuse after excuse and then turning the blame around on their customers . these people do not deserve your business and quite frankly ... ladies you deserve better . better clothing ( i have now purchased 6 items and been dissatisfied with the quality of all of them ... loose threads , flimsy , cheap fabric , wrong stitching for the fabric , no lining , incorrect fit for size , etc . ) and a greater degree of respect as a consumer .
DOC136 went here with my sister and her boyfriend for some drinks . we were hungry and ordered a few appetizers to share . drinks were fine ( my mix drink was on the very small side ) , but the food was really good . the perogies and `` chips '' and dip were excellent . the service was good and the atmosphere was nice , for such a small place . bathrooms were also nice , clean , etc . only problem is that some of the tables are so small , it 's really hard to use them . we were at a very small one and even though we fit around it alright , a guy walking by knocked a beer over with his coat and it dumped all down me . i mean all over me . it 's not the bar 's fault the guy knocked the glass , but if the table was a bit bigger we would have had more room to put the glass further in , so it would n't have gotten knocked in the first place . the fact is , if you 're going to serve food people need a place to put it . a few slightly bigger tables would go a long way .

DOC126 i had a craving for mexican and came here ( ie . yelp ) to figure out what we could do , because there is a very real lack of good mexican food in toronto . this place had some good reviews and was n't too far away from us , so off we went .  parking in leaside can be pretty brutal , but we finally found a space and luckily , street parking is free .  the restaurant is tacky , stereotypical , but cozy and we were quickly greeted and seated .  the menu has basic mexican fare , burritos , fajitas , tacos , with your choice of meat . nothing too outside of the box , but that 's not necessarily a bad thing .  we ordered the guacamole to start and i ordered a chicken enchilada and my husband ordered the chimichanga .  the guacamole is very delicious and creamy , but we had to ask for more nachos and even then it felt like not enough . we were really loading up the chips with the guacamole !  the food came out and the was served with rice , a salad ( sort of italian dressing with feta and tomatoes ) and refried beans . the salad was pretty generic and the rice was bland , but the actual main courses were great and the refried beans helped with the spice ( i 'm a wimp ) .  the appetizer and our main courses came to $ 30 and we were very full .  service was good and food was good and it was n't too expensive . it was n't perfect , but we 'll totally be back !
DOC127 came here with my mother , husband and baby for brunch\/lunch . we were all quite happy with our choice . i think i was the `` winner '' by ordering the french toast . it was practically half a loaf of bread , covered with fruit and with delicious cinnamon butter . my husband ordered the stoney 's breakfast , which is your basic eggs , toast , bacon , etc , meal . my mother ordered the omelet . huge portions , but at around $ 11- $ 13 per breakfast meal , it was on the steep end of brunches and other than mine , i 'm not sure the price is warranted , especially since it 's a order at the counter , then find a seat with your number and wait for your meal type place . people were friendly and service was good ( for what it was ) . i would give it a try if i was in the area again .
DOC128 never eaten at this place before , but it 's always crowded and i decided that must mean something . i was running errands and had n't eaten the whole day , so decided to finally give this place a shot . i ordered a chicken sandwich and iced tea .  the iced tea does n't appear to be iced tea . it was a dark reddish colour and tasted like very watered down pomegranate juice . it was inedible . it was super gross . i was thinking that maybe they made a mistake , but i ca n't see on the menu anything else it might be and the girl who took my order , poured the drink and gave it to me said it was iced tea . sooooo ew .  sandwich was alright , but just alright . the `` aroma sauce '' which is a garlic mayo of sorts was good and the roasted red peppers and mozzerella on the sandwich were good . the bread was good , but the chicken was the sort of cheap , crappy chicken you find at subway , where it 's a sort of compressed chicken-like white meat , with fake grill marks on it . it had no taste and really took away from the overall sandwich .  there are soups , salads and of course hot beverages served at this place as well , so i 'm not writing it off just yet , but this was not a good first impression .
DOC129 solid soup place ... has an ever-so-slightly sketchy vibe to it ... you order your soup and the woman disappears into the back ... usually closes the sliding window so you ca n't see back there and then eventually emerges with your soup . also seems to sell a selection of jamaican movies in dvd from a glass case ... sort of random .  generous with the veggies , less so with dumplings , but all the soups have great flavour and are decently sized for the price . i wish they would offer some bread or crackers for the soup ... would be a nice , easy add-on . but this place is what it is and does n't bother with the bells and whistles . really deserves a 3.5 stars . the red bean is my fav by far .
DOC130 i would be more inclined to give this place 3-1\/2 stars , but since that 's not possible , i 'm rounding down .  i went here for sunday lunch with a group for winterlicious . for $ 15 we got a choice of appetizer , entree and dessert .  we arrived first and our table was waiting for us . the restaurant was not busy at that point and our waiter was very attentive with water and the wine menu .  once our party finally arrived we all ordered . i had their chipotle sweet potato & goat cheese dip , which was average . the salads looked much better and got better reviews . same with the soup . the dip was literally a dollap of dip at the side of the plate with some crostinis on the other end and 1 piece of pickled cauliflower and a few slices of onion in the middle . the dip was good , the pickled cauliflower alright . it was nice when all combined on the crostini ( pickled veggies , dip on top of crostini ) .  i had originally wanted to order the double pork slider , but i saw it arrive at someone else 's table and it was literally just the one , single mini pork sandwich , with a few thinly cut fries at the side . it looked good , but it was appetizer size , if that . the chicken sandwich was more reasonably sized , so i ordered that . it was good . i really liked the bread . the macaroni was also more reasonably sized . i sampled it and it was fine . did n't blow me away .  dessert was the highlight of the meal for everyone i think . some people ordered the mousse , which i thought was fine , but the people who ordered it loved , so there you have it . my husband loved his apple terrine , which i tried and was good . i liked the flavour of my creme brule very much , but the top was over toasted and had hardened to the consistency of a thin , hard candy . it was hard to break with my spoon and got stuck in my teeth .  the service was consistently good , so no complaints there . none of us had wine with our lunch ( although some had other drinks ) , so i ca n't comment there .  this is a tapas bar , so i expect sizes to be small . but when sizes are small i expect them to be priced accordingly and\/or to be in sharable portions . they gave the prices of each dish if you were to purchased them individually . these would all be hard to share and would n't really be worth it . they are nice as a winterlicious meal , but i 'm not sure this would be my first choice to go back to .
DOC131 i am surprised at the people complaining about the service , because we found the service to be fine . especially given how busy and cramped it was . there were no tables , but they got us seats at the bar . the music was maybe a little loud , but i enjoyed the 90s throwback that was happening . the place looks like a dive , it 's a total hole in the wall , with no signs to speak of , but i liked the weird atmosphere of weird , old `` ghetto blasters '' on the walls and pics of arnold in terminator . it 's random , just go with it ... but the food ... .oh the food ! we were told that the squash poutine was a must have , so i ordered that and the bulgogi cheese steak , while my friend ordered the poutine and the mackerel . the mackerel was served first . it arrived raw , on a platter and a torch was taken to it to sear the outside and that was it . my friend allowed me a bite and it was so fresh tasting , with a delicious marinade . next came by bulgogi sandwich . fresh , delicious bread and amazing bulgogi . was very pleased . finally the `` poutines '' arrived . i should say that it was not what we were expecting . i assumed it would be squash on top of fries . but in fact the squash was the fries . they were lightly fried and covered in a variety of sauce `` gravies '' and scallions and some other stuff that i could neither make out , nor even see clearly ( dim lighting ) . it does n't matter okay ... .this stuff was heaven ! both my friend and i took a bite and looked at each other ... and proclaimed our new favourite food . other people in our party got the wings , which looked amazing and they said they were and the loosey , which was also proclaimed as delicious . so basically there were no wrong moves . the drink menu was very adventurous ... more so than we were , because we did n't take the plunge , although it was fun sitting at the bar and watching the bartender creating them . and splitting the bill for my friend with two others ( her birthday ) , my two `` tapas '' and a generic alcoholic beverage came to just under $ 30 . the prices are extremely reasonable ... and honestly once you try this stuff ... i mean , i do n't want to give them any ideas , but i would have paid more for that fine , fine food . i will be back . need me some more of that poutine !
DOC132 our friends got the groupon for four people and took us along . i 'm very pleased we went ! having never had ethiopian food before , we were curious , but wary . the deal really helped us dive in . it included two appetizers , four main courses and two desserts . we started with two appetizers , one i was n't a huge fan of ( a `` salad '' with a strong vinegar taste and jalapenos , which i found too strong , although other people in my group really liked it ) . the other appetizer was similar to an indian samosa ( similar name too , but i ca n't remember exactly what it was called ) . they were stuff with lentils and had a flaky shell . they were delicious . but , their appetizers were only made for three people , so there were only three of them ! seems silly when you offer a four person deal . we each ordered a different main course and they brought them on one large platter , so we could all share . we ordered two vegetarian options , one of lentils and one of chickpeas and one of chicken and one of beef . basically , the meals are more sauces than anything and they are served with injera , which are sort of bland , cold , bread-like stuff , which comes rolled up . they 're nothing special , but they 're only used as a sort of utensil , because you use it to scoop up the food . the food was delicious ! i especially liked the chickpea dish . every one of us ended up liking a different dish the best ! worked out well . i personally found the beef dish very tough though . once we were stuff with the food , we ordered two desserts . we especially liked the cheesecake ( which is obviously not ethiopian ) . we asked if they had any ethiopian coffees and they said yes . they showed us the beans , as they were being roasted . then they came back out with a sort of stone earthenware kettle and some small cups . the coffee was so rich , it was almost like chocolate . they also served it with a large basket of popcorn , which was just perfectly prepared . it was such a nice after dinner snack ! i would totally come here just to order the coffee ! it would have been a very expensive dinner without the groupon , so i 'm not sure i would make this a regularly destination , but as i said , the coffee was fantastic and it 's a fun thing to try , especially with friends . make sure they 're good ones , that you do n't mind getting messy in front of !
DOC133 a little on the pricey end for baked goods , but the baked goods are good . also their coffee products are great . the set up is annoying ( order your desserts on one side and coffee and food on another side ) , but the service is good and overall they do a good job .
DOC134 my sister told me that origin was well known for their delicious brunches , so we made a trip there to see if this was the case . origin is pretty new in our area and is very large , but nicely decorated . my only comment would be the washrooms , which feature communal sinks , the kind you find in elementary schools , where you step on the thing at the bottom and water comes out all around . besides not being very effective to quickly wash hands , it 's also wasteful if you 're the only one there . strange concept . throw back , but not necessarily one wants to remember during their brunch . now onto the important part ... the food and service . service started out alright and then immediately got very slow . it took some time to get our drink orders and then took a long time to get our actual orders . i ordered their french toast , my sister ordered tostada and my husband skipped brunch and ordered a meal they offered of a burger , fries covered in some chorizo and sauce and a float . i also ordered a side of bacon ... and was told that they were out of bacon ... which meant any orders that would have come with bacon were out entirely , or would be served without bacon . i 'm sorry but a brunch restaurant without bacon ? even the waitress admitted it was ridiculous . we also shared a plate of buscuits with their preserves . these were delicious . apparently my meal was the one that took the longest . the others got their food and we still waited for five minutes before mine came out . who knew it would take so long to put a couple of pieces of bread on a plate and cover them with blueberry preserves ? my sister said her tostada was quite good . my french toast was nothing special . the toast was `` fancy '' , rounded pieces , on top of each other with whipped cream and blueberries in between . the `` maple '' which was supposed to be on the plate ( maple syrup i 'm guessing ) was barely present . tasted like something i could have created with some ease . my husband 's dish was the best by far . his burger was juicy and this fries were great . the float was a little silly ... this big , meaty burger and fries covered in more meat ... paired with a cream soda float in pink and white layers . ( not insulting , we just got a laugh ) . nothing was cheap and then we had to wait a long time again to get our bill and pay . this was all strange because the restaurant was not particularly busy . because the brunch itself did n't blow me away , food shortages and service , i 'm not sure if i would bother with brunch again . oliver and bonicini in the actual mall has a much better brunch . i might try this again for lunch or dinner though .
DOC135 the saga has finished ... .because i needed to end this bs and move on .  so first off , the store owner responded to my complaints ... by blaming me . apparently it is my fault they sent the wrong thing , because i sent an email and then followed it up with a phone call ... which confused them and made them think there were two orders or something . which makes zero sense , because two orders were not sent . and the person i was speaking with on the phone responded to the emails i sent with codes to try out ... .so i have a hard time believing that they were confused by what was going on and thought that the phone order and email order were different .  they also told me they blocked me on instagram because i was body shaming their models . i want to be very clear on this . i never once body shamed , or made any comments on instagram about their models . i asked why they were promoting clothing they do n't even have in stock on instagram ... apparently that equates to body shaming to them .  they also informed me that because they had to mail so many orders to me ( 3 ) , they were going to start to charge me for shipping . they seemed to forget that i had also been paying to ship items back to them and that i had specifically chosen times when they had free shipping promos taking place to place orders . it 's not that they were n't charging me for shipping ... it was that i was taking advantage of their own promos . apparently i ca n't use their promos anymore , because they have placed an arbitrary rules on how many times you can make a return now . at least for me .  they did not address the code not working .  i responded and expressed continued frustration at their lack of ownership over their mistakes and how poor their customer service continued to be .  then i did some research and sent another email . instead of returning the dress i would donate it to dress for success . i said this seemed like a better choice than continuing to mail clothing back and forth . my request to them was that they take the would be money they would spend on continuing to mail me clothing and take some ownership for their mistakes and channel it into something good . i asked that they take the remaining $ 9.98 credit i had and put it towards them making a small donation , either monetarily or a piece of clothing , also to the charity . i stated that their continued neglect for customer service and lack of ownership over repeated problems should be owned up to , but if they would n't do it for me , perhaps they would be willing to do so for someone in need . i said that would conclude our business and bring something good out of this ridiculousness .  a few hours later i received an email with a letter of thanks for a donation made to dress for success ... for the amount of $ 10 via the store ... .so my remainder amount i had paid for and big sis closet 's contribution of ... .two cents . their generosity is astounding . now , i do n't know that they have n't made their own donation and just not told me of course ... i 'll let you guys decide whether you want to give them the benefit of the doubt in that regard . but given that they have taken zero responsibility for the continued poor management and customer service , well ... i think you can guess what my thoughts are on the subject . no further correspondence was sent from the actual store .  but at any rate , i am donating the new dress to dress for success ( along with my $ 9.98 ) and i am officially done with this store for good . and i sincerely hope that people read this review and think twice about shopping here . the clothes are not good quality , but more than that ... i have never experienced such insanely bad management and customer service in my life . zero regard for their customers , zero regard for their own mistakes , zero regard for taking ownership of ... anything ! just excuse after excuse and then turning the blame around on their customers . these people do not deserve your business and quite frankly ... ladies you deserve better . better clothing ( i have now purchased 6 items and been dissatisfied with the quality of all of them ... loose threads , flimsy , cheap fabric , wrong stitching for the fabric , no lining , incorrect fit for size , etc . ) and a greater degree of respect as a consumer .
DOC136 went here with my sister and her boyfriend for some drinks . we were hungry and ordered a few appetizers to share . drinks were fine ( my mix drink was on the very small side ) , but the food was really good . the perogies and `` chips '' and dip were excellent . the service was good and the atmosphere was nice , for such a small place . bathrooms were also nice , clean , etc . only problem is that some of the tables are so small , it 's really hard to use them . we were at a very small one and even though we fit around it alright , a guy walking by knocked a beer over with his coat and it dumped all down me . i mean all over me . it 's not the bar 's fault the guy knocked the glass , but if the table was a bit bigger we would have had more room to put the glass further in , so it would n't have gotten knocked in the first place . the fact is , if you 're going to serve food people need a place to put it . a few slightly bigger tables would go a long way .
DOC121 after being scared away from rock & rita 's , we ended up at this place , which was , if nothing else , quieter .  i 'll start by saying that the hostess and our server were both lovely and they 're really what earned the single star , because they were sweet , but the food was just horrible .  i ordered a simple grilled cheese sandwich . i asked the server if it was processed cheese , or `` real '' cheese in the sandwich and he had no idea what i was talking about . i tried to clarify by saying , `` is it like kraft single slices , or deli cheese ? '' he said it was `` good '' . this really should have been a sign and i could probably fault the waiter for this , since you should know what you 're serving , but he was so sweet , i could n't be mad !  my husband ordered a hot dog of sorts .  i asked if there was a way to substitute fries for a salad . there was not , but the server hooked me up and brought me a salad anyway ( no charge ) . i asked for sweet potato fries with the sandwich .  of course , my sandwich was made with plasticy , processed cheese , that was melted to the point of cheeze-wiz and was inedible . i took one bite of the sandwich and could n't do another . i got regular fries , instead of sweet potato ( did n't bother complaining , because i got the free salad , so whatever ... like i said , nice server ! ) my husband 's food was fine , although nothing special . they were good with the refills of our drinks .  anyway , as nice as the servers were , it was n't good . i would avoid eating here if i could .
DOC122 we got recommendations for this place from my parents and so , for our anniversary , we booked here . we were told though that it was first come , first served , in terms of having the ideal seats by the windows that overlook the fountains of the bellagio and the strip . we went for lunch though , so it was n't too busy . we were seated by the window and were promptly served some sort of puffed rolls , with cheese and herbs infused . they were delicious !  we ordered the onion soup to start and i ordered parmesan chicken and my husband ordered a lamb burger . our food came and was delicious . the soup was probably my favorite part . we were feeling very full by the end and so declined dessert , but were still given some jellies and chocolate truffle and then were served a small chocolate mousse , on a decorated plate that said happy anniversary , which was a total surprise ( they had asked when i booked if it was a special occasion , but had said nothing while we were there ) . overall the service was great , the food delicious and the view wonderful . it was a great experience !
DOC123 i went here for the first time yesterday night to celebrate something with my family . several members of my family have been to this place before for summerlicious and really enjoyed it .  a nice atmosphere and excellent service , everyone ordered a variety of different dishes , many of which i tasted . i myself had a chicken salad and thought it was very good . my sister 's pasta dish was amazing though ! our waiter never rushed us out and was quick to refill water and bread and clear dishes , etc . that with an arm brace on !  prices are a little high , which is why i did n't give this place five stars ... i know those amazing places exist out there with great food and great prices , but this was a nice evening out .
DOC124 worst experience ever ! i had been there before to get my nails done and the first time was quite good , but the second time was a hot mess . it looked like a five year old did my nails for me . i went home and took the polish off . but this is the kicker : i could n't get an appointment for highlights at my regular salon and this was close by , so i decided to give it a try ( obviously the nail girl would n't be doing my hair ) . i went in and sat down the a woman with an eastern european accent came to talk with me . i showed her a picture of what i wanted and she showed me various hair dye samples ... .none of which looked like my picture , but i always assume the hair dressers know what 's best . now , you 're all thinking , `` ..and she did a poor job and you hated the colour ... '' right ? nope , she told me she could n't do my hair because i had lice ! of course i freaked out . another hair dresser came over to see if i was alright and i was mortified . she asked if i had experienced any itching . i said no . this hairdresser turned back to the original hairdresser and asked if maybe it was n't too bad yet , but original hairdresser said it was really , really bad . i freaked out and left ( obviously without having anything done ) and went to a shoppers and bought lice shampoo . i went home and had my husband look at my hair . he looked and looked and could find nothing . i still did n't want to take chances , so we tore the house apart and washed and bagged everything and i went to a walk-in clinic . the doctor looked at my head and also said there was nothing there ! since i was paranoid , i still used the shampoo and anytime my head itched in the slightest i went to examine it . but even with my husband and mother looking at my head , we never found a single thing . we did n't even see dandruff ! ! i went to a hairdresser a week later and they told me my hair was beautiful ... but dry at the ends ... yeah , because of the chemical-filled lice shampoo ! thanks a lot you crazy woman ! so ultimately , i never had lice . i do n't know if this woman just decided she did n't feel like doing my hair , or if she was delusional , but i sure wo n't be going back there ever again . no one else should either , unless you want to risk being embarrassed and inconvenienced .

DOC130 i would be more inclined to give this place 3-1\/2 stars , but since that 's not possible , i 'm rounding down .  i went here for sunday lunch with a group for winterlicious . for $ 15 we got a choice of appetizer , entree and dessert .  we arrived first and our table was waiting for us . the restaurant was not busy at that point and our waiter was very attentive with water and the wine menu .  once our party finally arrived we all ordered . i had their chipotle sweet potato & goat cheese dip , which was average . the salads looked much better and got better reviews . same with the soup . the dip was literally a dollap of dip at the side of the plate with some crostinis on the other end and 1 piece of pickled cauliflower and a few slices of onion in the middle . the dip was good , the pickled cauliflower alright . it was nice when all combined on the crostini ( pickled veggies , dip on top of crostini ) .  i had originally wanted to order the double pork slider , but i saw it arrive at someone else 's table and it was literally just the one , single mini pork sandwich , with a few thinly cut fries at the side . it looked good , but it was appetizer size , if that . the chicken sandwich was more reasonably sized , so i ordered that . it was good . i really liked the bread . the macaroni was also more reasonably sized . i sampled it and it was fine . did n't blow me away .  dessert was the highlight of the meal for everyone i think . some people ordered the mousse , which i thought was fine , but the people who ordered it loved , so there you have it . my husband loved his apple terrine , which i tried and was good . i liked the flavour of my creme brule very much , but the top was over toasted and had hardened to the consistency of a thin , hard candy . it was hard to break with my spoon and got stuck in my teeth .  the service was consistently good , so no complaints there . none of us had wine with our lunch ( although some had other drinks ) , so i ca n't comment there .  this is a tapas bar , so i expect sizes to be small . but when sizes are small i expect them to be priced accordingly and\/or to be in sharable portions . they gave the prices of each dish if you were to purchased them individually . these would all be hard to share and would n't really be worth it . they are nice as a winterlicious meal , but i 'm not sure this would be my first choice to go back to .
DOC121 after being scared away from rock & rita 's , we ended up at this place , which was , if nothing else , quieter .  i 'll start by saying that the hostess and our server were both lovely and they 're really what earned the single star , because they were sweet , but the food was just horrible .  i ordered a simple grilled cheese sandwich . i asked the server if it was processed cheese , or `` real '' cheese in the sandwich and he had no idea what i was talking about . i tried to clarify by saying , `` is it like kraft single slices , or deli cheese ? '' he said it was `` good '' . this really should have been a sign and i could probably fault the waiter for this , since you should know what you 're serving , but he was so sweet , i could n't be mad !  my husband ordered a hot dog of sorts .  i asked if there was a way to substitute fries for a salad . there was not , but the server hooked me up and brought me a salad anyway ( no charge ) . i asked for sweet potato fries with the sandwich .  of course , my sandwich was made with plasticy , processed cheese , that was melted to the point of cheeze-wiz and was inedible . i took one bite of the sandwich and could n't do another . i got regular fries , instead of sweet potato ( did n't bother complaining , because i got the free salad , so whatever ... like i said , nice server ! ) my husband 's food was fine , although nothing special . they were good with the refills of our drinks .  anyway , as nice as the servers were , it was n't good . i would avoid eating here if i could .
DOC122 we got recommendations for this place from my parents and so , for our anniversary , we booked here . we were told though that it was first come , first served , in terms of having the ideal seats by the windows that overlook the fountains of the bellagio and the strip . we went for lunch though , so it was n't too busy . we were seated by the window and were promptly served some sort of puffed rolls , with cheese and herbs infused . they were delicious !  we ordered the onion soup to start and i ordered parmesan chicken and my husband ordered a lamb burger . our food came and was delicious . the soup was probably my favorite part . we were feeling very full by the end and so declined dessert , but were still given some jellies and chocolate truffle and then were served a small chocolate mousse , on a decorated plate that said happy anniversary , which was a total surprise ( they had asked when i booked if it was a special occasion , but had said nothing while we were there ) . overall the service was great , the food delicious and the view wonderful . it was a great experience !
DOC123 i went here for the first time yesterday night to celebrate something with my family . several members of my family have been to this place before for summerlicious and really enjoyed it .  a nice atmosphere and excellent service , everyone ordered a variety of different dishes , many of which i tasted . i myself had a chicken salad and thought it was very good . my sister 's pasta dish was amazing though ! our waiter never rushed us out and was quick to refill water and bread and clear dishes , etc . that with an arm brace on !  prices are a little high , which is why i did n't give this place five stars ... i know those amazing places exist out there with great food and great prices , but this was a nice evening out .
DOC124 worst experience ever ! i had been there before to get my nails done and the first time was quite good , but the second time was a hot mess . it looked like a five year old did my nails for me . i went home and took the polish off . but this is the kicker : i could n't get an appointment for highlights at my regular salon and this was close by , so i decided to give it a try ( obviously the nail girl would n't be doing my hair ) . i went in and sat down the a woman with an eastern european accent came to talk with me . i showed her a picture of what i wanted and she showed me various hair dye samples ... .none of which looked like my picture , but i always assume the hair dressers know what 's best . now , you 're all thinking , `` ..and she did a poor job and you hated the colour ... '' right ? nope , she told me she could n't do my hair because i had lice ! of course i freaked out . another hair dresser came over to see if i was alright and i was mortified . she asked if i had experienced any itching . i said no . this hairdresser turned back to the original hairdresser and asked if maybe it was n't too bad yet , but original hairdresser said it was really , really bad . i freaked out and left ( obviously without having anything done ) and went to a shoppers and bought lice shampoo . i went home and had my husband look at my hair . he looked and looked and could find nothing . i still did n't want to take chances , so we tore the house apart and washed and bagged everything and i went to a walk-in clinic . the doctor looked at my head and also said there was nothing there ! since i was paranoid , i still used the shampoo and anytime my head itched in the slightest i went to examine it . but even with my husband and mother looking at my head , we never found a single thing . we did n't even see dandruff ! ! i went to a hairdresser a week later and they told me my hair was beautiful ... but dry at the ends ... yeah , because of the chemical-filled lice shampoo ! thanks a lot you crazy woman ! so ultimately , i never had lice . i do n't know if this woman just decided she did n't feel like doing my hair , or if she was delusional , but i sure wo n't be going back there ever again . no one else should either , unless you want to risk being embarrassed and inconvenienced .
DOC125 i love cupcakes . seriously ... .love affair ! so i 'm always on the lookout for new cupcake places . i was in scarborough town centre and came upon this kiosk . it 's not a storefront , but a rather ingenious booth , with colourful signs and a glass showcase full of cupcakes .  there is a long list of flavours and i suspect ( as with many places ) they make different cupcakes for different days .  i ordered 6 , which was $ 18 ... i know , it 's steep , that 's pretty standard . cupcake places seem to range from around the $ 2.25 mark to around $ 4\/cupcake . so these guys fall somewhere inbetween . but not cheap , so i expect excellence , needless to say .  now , here 's the strange thing . on their website each cupcake is listed as $ 2.90 ... .was this the case at the store ? ? i sure hope not . why would you have to pay more for buying more ? maybe it 's an ordering online thing ? anyway , my guess is that you 're paying $ 3\/cupcake at the store , or $ 18 for 6 . no real incentive to buy 6 . but i did , so moving on ... .  of course i chose a range of flavours : oreo cookie . chocolate with vanilla icing , salted caramel , lemon and a double chocolate .  over two days we managed to work our way through them ( myself and my husband ) and i nibbled the different flavours . lemon was my favorite , by far , with the salted caramel being a huge disappointment . it was entirely too salty . more salt than caramel . it was n't very good at all .  but that said , none of the cupcakes really blew me away . and in fact , they were very stale the next day , despite being stored in an airtight container , in the fridge . luckily , the cold buttercream frosting was easy to scoop off and once they had been in the oven for a few minutes , they softened up a bit .  the bottoms of the cupcakes stuck to the wrappers and the flavours were dull tasting and uninspired .  i was also surprised at the lack of creativity in terms of christmas flavours or designed . right before christmas you would expect some special flavours ... maybe a candy cane , or gingerbread cupcake . it would be so easy to switch out one flavour and try to get people to consider your product for a christmas party dessert .  having a little kiosk in a mall is a smart idea . sadly , this business is not one i think i will bother with again !
DOC126 i had a craving for mexican and came here ( ie . yelp ) to figure out what we could do , because there is a very real lack of good mexican food in toronto . this place had some good reviews and was n't too far away from us , so off we went .  parking in leaside can be pretty brutal , but we finally found a space and luckily , street parking is free .  the restaurant is tacky , stereotypical , but cozy and we were quickly greeted and seated .  the menu has basic mexican fare , burritos , fajitas , tacos , with your choice of meat . nothing too outside of the box , but that 's not necessarily a bad thing .  we ordered the guacamole to start and i ordered a chicken enchilada and my husband ordered the chimichanga .  the guacamole is very delicious and creamy , but we had to ask for more nachos and even then it felt like not enough . we were really loading up the chips with the guacamole !  the food came out and the was served with rice , a salad ( sort of italian dressing with feta and tomatoes ) and refried beans . the salad was pretty generic and the rice was bland , but the actual main courses were great and the refried beans helped with the spice ( i 'm a wimp ) .  the appetizer and our main courses came to $ 30 and we were very full .  service was good and food was good and it was n't too expensive . it was n't perfect , but we 'll totally be back !
DOC127 came here with my mother , husband and baby for brunch\/lunch . we were all quite happy with our choice . i think i was the `` winner '' by ordering the french toast . it was practically half a loaf of bread , covered with fruit and with delicious cinnamon butter . my husband ordered the stoney 's breakfast , which is your basic eggs , toast , bacon , etc , meal . my mother ordered the omelet . huge portions , but at around $ 11- $ 13 per breakfast meal , it was on the steep end of brunches and other than mine , i 'm not sure the price is warranted , especially since it 's a order at the counter , then find a seat with your number and wait for your meal type place . people were friendly and service was good ( for what it was ) . i would give it a try if i was in the area again .

DOC131 i am surprised at the people complaining about the service , because we found the service to be fine . especially given how busy and cramped it was . there were no tables , but they got us seats at the bar . the music was maybe a little loud , but i enjoyed the 90s throwback that was happening . the place looks like a dive , it 's a total hole in the wall , with no signs to speak of , but i liked the weird atmosphere of weird , old `` ghetto blasters '' on the walls and pics of arnold in terminator . it 's random , just go with it ... but the food ... .oh the food ! we were told that the squash poutine was a must have , so i ordered that and the bulgogi cheese steak , while my friend ordered the poutine and the mackerel . the mackerel was served first . it arrived raw , on a platter and a torch was taken to it to sear the outside and that was it . my friend allowed me a bite and it was so fresh tasting , with a delicious marinade . next came by bulgogi sandwich . fresh , delicious bread and amazing bulgogi . was very pleased . finally the `` poutines '' arrived . i should say that it was not what we were expecting . i assumed it would be squash on top of fries . but in fact the squash was the fries . they were lightly fried and covered in a variety of sauce `` gravies '' and scallions and some other stuff that i could neither make out , nor even see clearly ( dim lighting ) . it does n't matter okay ... .this stuff was heaven ! both my friend and i took a bite and looked at each other ... and proclaimed our new favourite food . other people in our party got the wings , which looked amazing and they said they were and the loosey , which was also proclaimed as delicious . so basically there were no wrong moves . the drink menu was very adventurous ... more so than we were , because we did n't take the plunge , although it was fun sitting at the bar and watching the bartender creating them . and splitting the bill for my friend with two others ( her birthday ) , my two `` tapas '' and a generic alcoholic beverage came to just under $ 30 . the prices are extremely reasonable ... and honestly once you try this stuff ... i mean , i do n't want to give them any ideas , but i would have paid more for that fine , fine food . i will be back . need me some more of that poutine !
DOC132 our friends got the groupon for four people and took us along . i 'm very pleased we went ! having never had ethiopian food before , we were curious , but wary . the deal really helped us dive in . it included two appetizers , four main courses and two desserts . we started with two appetizers , one i was n't a huge fan of ( a `` salad '' with a strong vinegar taste and jalapenos , which i found too strong , although other people in my group really liked it ) . the other appetizer was similar to an indian samosa ( similar name too , but i ca n't remember exactly what it was called ) . they were stuff with lentils and had a flaky shell . they were delicious . but , their appetizers were only made for three people , so there were only three of them ! seems silly when you offer a four person deal . we each ordered a different main course and they brought them on one large platter , so we could all share . we ordered two vegetarian options , one of lentils and one of chickpeas and one of chicken and one of beef . basically , the meals are more sauces than anything and they are served with injera , which are sort of bland , cold , bread-like stuff , which comes rolled up . they 're nothing special , but they 're only used as a sort of utensil , because you use it to scoop up the food . the food was delicious ! i especially liked the chickpea dish . every one of us ended up liking a different dish the best ! worked out well . i personally found the beef dish very tough though . once we were stuff with the food , we ordered two desserts . we especially liked the cheesecake ( which is obviously not ethiopian ) . we asked if they had any ethiopian coffees and they said yes . they showed us the beans , as they were being roasted . then they came back out with a sort of stone earthenware kettle and some small cups . the coffee was so rich , it was almost like chocolate . they also served it with a large basket of popcorn , which was just perfectly prepared . it was such a nice after dinner snack ! i would totally come here just to order the coffee ! it would have been a very expensive dinner without the groupon , so i 'm not sure i would make this a regularly destination , but as i said , the coffee was fantastic and it 's a fun thing to try , especially with friends . make sure they 're good ones , that you do n't mind getting messy in front of !
DOC133 a little on the pricey end for baked goods , but the baked goods are good . also their coffee products are great . the set up is annoying ( order your desserts on one side and coffee and food on another side ) , but the service is good and overall they do a good job .
DOC134 my sister told me that origin was well known for their delicious brunches , so we made a trip there to see if this was the case . origin is pretty new in our area and is very large , but nicely decorated . my only comment would be the washrooms , which feature communal sinks , the kind you find in elementary schools , where you step on the thing at the bottom and water comes out all around . besides not being very effective to quickly wash hands , it 's also wasteful if you 're the only one there . strange concept . throw back , but not necessarily one wants to remember during their brunch . now onto the important part ... the food and service . service started out alright and then immediately got very slow . it took some time to get our drink orders and then took a long time to get our actual orders . i ordered their french toast , my sister ordered tostada and my husband skipped brunch and ordered a meal they offered of a burger , fries covered in some chorizo and sauce and a float . i also ordered a side of bacon ... and was told that they were out of bacon ... which meant any orders that would have come with bacon were out entirely , or would be served without bacon . i 'm sorry but a brunch restaurant without bacon ? even the waitress admitted it was ridiculous . we also shared a plate of buscuits with their preserves . these were delicious . apparently my meal was the one that took the longest . the others got their food and we still waited for five minutes before mine came out . who knew it would take so long to put a couple of pieces of bread on a plate and cover them with blueberry preserves ? my sister said her tostada was quite good . my french toast was nothing special . the toast was `` fancy '' , rounded pieces , on top of each other with whipped cream and blueberries in between . the `` maple '' which was supposed to be on the plate ( maple syrup i 'm guessing ) was barely present . tasted like something i could have created with some ease . my husband 's dish was the best by far . his burger was juicy and this fries were great . the float was a little silly ... this big , meaty burger and fries covered in more meat ... paired with a cream soda float in pink and white layers . ( not insulting , we just got a laugh ) . nothing was cheap and then we had to wait a long time again to get our bill and pay . this was all strange because the restaurant was not particularly busy . because the brunch itself did n't blow me away , food shortages and service , i 'm not sure if i would bother with brunch again . oliver and bonicini in the actual mall has a much better brunch . i might try this again for lunch or dinner though .
DOC135 the saga has finished ... .because i needed to end this bs and move on .  so first off , the store owner responded to my complaints ... by blaming me . apparently it is my fault they sent the wrong thing , because i sent an email and then followed it up with a phone call ... which confused them and made them think there were two orders or something . which makes zero sense , because two orders were not sent . and the person i was speaking with on the phone responded to the emails i sent with codes to try out ... .so i have a hard time believing that they were confused by what was going on and thought that the phone order and email order were different .  they also told me they blocked me on instagram because i was body shaming their models . i want to be very clear on this . i never once body shamed , or made any comments on instagram about their models . i asked why they were promoting clothing they do n't even have in stock on instagram ... apparently that equates to body shaming to them .  they also informed me that because they had to mail so many orders to me ( 3 ) , they were going to start to charge me for shipping . they seemed to forget that i had also been paying to ship items back to them and that i had specifically chosen times when they had free shipping promos taking place to place orders . it 's not that they were n't charging me for shipping ... it was that i was taking advantage of their own promos . apparently i ca n't use their promos anymore , because they have placed an arbitrary rules on how many times you can make a return now . at least for me .  they did not address the code not working .  i responded and expressed continued frustration at their lack of ownership over their mistakes and how poor their customer service continued to be .  then i did some research and sent another email . instead of returning the dress i would donate it to dress for success . i said this seemed like a better choice than continuing to mail clothing back and forth . my request to them was that they take the would be money they would spend on continuing to mail me clothing and take some ownership for their mistakes and channel it into something good . i asked that they take the remaining $ 9.98 credit i had and put it towards them making a small donation , either monetarily or a piece of clothing , also to the charity . i stated that their continued neglect for customer service and lack of ownership over repeated problems should be owned up to , but if they would n't do it for me , perhaps they would be willing to do so for someone in need . i said that would conclude our business and bring something good out of this ridiculousness .  a few hours later i received an email with a letter of thanks for a donation made to dress for success ... for the amount of $ 10 via the store ... .so my remainder amount i had paid for and big sis closet 's contribution of ... .two cents . their generosity is astounding . now , i do n't know that they have n't made their own donation and just not told me of course ... i 'll let you guys decide whether you want to give them the benefit of the doubt in that regard . but given that they have taken zero responsibility for the continued poor management and customer service , well ... i think you can guess what my thoughts are on the subject . no further correspondence was sent from the actual store .  but at any rate , i am donating the new dress to dress for success ( along with my $ 9.98 ) and i am officially done with this store for good . and i sincerely hope that people read this review and think twice about shopping here . the clothes are not good quality , but more than that ... i have never experienced such insanely bad management and customer service in my life . zero regard for their customers , zero regard for their own mistakes , zero regard for taking ownership of ... anything ! just excuse after excuse and then turning the blame around on their customers . these people do not deserve your business and quite frankly ... ladies you deserve better . better clothing ( i have now purchased 6 items and been dissatisfied with the quality of all of them ... loose threads , flimsy , cheap fabric , wrong stitching for the fabric , no lining , incorrect fit for size , etc . ) and a greater degree of respect as a consumer .
DOC136 went here with my sister and her boyfriend for some drinks . we were hungry and ordered a few appetizers to share . drinks were fine ( my mix drink was on the very small side ) , but the food was really good . the perogies and `` chips '' and dip were excellent . the service was good and the atmosphere was nice , for such a small place . bathrooms were also nice , clean , etc . only problem is that some of the tables are so small , it 's really hard to use them . we were at a very small one and even though we fit around it alright , a guy walking by knocked a beer over with his coat and it dumped all down me . i mean all over me . it 's not the bar 's fault the guy knocked the glass , but if the table was a bit bigger we would have had more room to put the glass further in , so it would n't have gotten knocked in the first place . the fact is , if you 're going to serve food people need a place to put it . a few slightly bigger tables would go a long way .

'' right ? nope , she told me she could n't do my hair because i had lice ! of course i freaked out . another hair dresser came over to see if i was alright and i was mortified . she asked if i had experienced any itching . i said no . this hairdresser turned back to the original hairdresser and asked if maybe it was n't too bad yet , but original hairdresser said it was really , really bad . i freaked out and left ( obviously without having anything done ) and went to a shoppers and bought lice shampoo . i went home and had my husband look at my hair . he looked and looked and could find nothing . i still did n't want to take chances , so we tore the house apart and washed and bagged everything and i went to a walk-in clinic . the doctor looked at my head and also said there was nothing there ! since i was paranoid , i still used the shampoo and anytime my head itched in the slightest i went to examine it . but even with my husband and mother looking at my head , we never found a single thing . we did n't even see dandruff ! ! i went to a hairdresser a week later and they told me my hair was beautiful ... but dry at the ends ... yeah , because of the chemical-filled lice shampoo ! thanks a lot you crazy woman ! so ultimately , i never had lice . i do n't know if this woman just decided she did n't feel like doing my hair , or if she was delusional , but i sure wo n't be going back there ever again . no one else should either , unless you want to risk being embarrassed and inconvenienced .
DOC125 i love cupcakes . seriously ... .love affair ! so i 'm always on the lookout for new cupcake places . i was in scarborough town centre and came upon this kiosk . it 's not a storefront , but a rather ingenious booth , with colourful signs and a glass showcase full of cupcakes .  there is a long list of flavours and i suspect ( as with many places ) they make different cupcakes for different days .  i ordered 6 , which was $ 18 ... i know , it 's steep , that 's pretty standard . cupcake places seem to range from around the $ 2.25 mark to around $ 4\/cupcake . so these guys fall somewhere inbetween . but not cheap , so i expect excellence , needless to say .  now , here 's the strange thing . on their website each cupcake is listed as $ 2.90 ... .was this the case at the store ? ? i sure hope not . why would you have to pay more for buying more ? maybe it 's an ordering online thing ? anyway , my guess is that you 're paying $ 3\/cupcake at the store , or $ 18 for 6 . no real incentive to buy 6 . but i did , so moving on ... .  of course i chose a range of flavours : oreo cookie . chocolate with vanilla icing , salted caramel , lemon and a double chocolate .  over two days we managed to work our way through them ( myself and my husband ) and i nibbled the different flavours . lemon was my favorite , by far , with the salted caramel being a huge disappointment . it was entirely too salty . more salt than caramel . it was n't very good at all .  but that said , none of the cupcakes really blew me away . and in fact , they were very stale the next day , despite being stored in an airtight container , in the fridge . luckily , the cold buttercream frosting was easy to scoop off and once they had been in the oven for a few minutes , they softened up a bit .  the bottoms of the cupcakes stuck to the wrappers and the flavours were dull tasting and uninspired .  i was also surprised at the lack of creativity in terms of christmas flavours or designed . right before christmas you would expect some special flavours ... maybe a candy cane , or gingerbread cupcake . it would be so easy to switch out one flavour and try to get people to consider your product for a christmas party dessert .  having a little kiosk in a mall is a smart idea . sadly , this business is not one i think i will bother with again !
DOC126 i had a craving for mexican and came here ( ie . yelp ) to figure out what we could do , because there is a very real lack of good mexican food in toronto . this place had some good reviews and was n't too far away from us , so off we went .  parking in leaside can be pretty brutal , but we finally found a space and luckily , street parking is free .  the restaurant is tacky , stereotypical , but cozy and we were quickly greeted and seated .  the menu has basic mexican fare , burritos , fajitas , tacos , with your choice of meat . nothing too outside of the box , but that 's not necessarily a bad thing .  we ordered the guacamole to start and i ordered a chicken enchilada and my husband ordered the chimichanga .  the guacamole is very delicious and creamy , but we had to ask for more nachos and even then it felt like not enough . we were really loading up the chips with the guacamole !  the food came out and the was served with rice , a salad ( sort of italian dressing with feta and tomatoes ) and refried beans . the salad was pretty generic and the rice was bland , but the actual main courses were great and the refried beans helped with the spice ( i 'm a wimp ) .  the appetizer and our main courses came to $ 30 and we were very full .  service was good and food was good and it was n't too expensive . it was n't perfect , but we 'll totally be back !
DOC127 came here with my mother , husband and baby for brunch\/lunch . we were all quite happy with our choice . i think i was the `` winner '' by ordering the french toast . it was practically half a loaf of bread , covered with fruit and with delicious cinnamon butter . my husband ordered the stoney 's breakfast , which is your basic eggs , toast , bacon , etc , meal . my mother ordered the omelet . huge portions , but at around $ 11- $ 13 per breakfast meal , it was on the steep end of brunches and other than mine , i 'm not sure the price is warranted , especially since it 's a order at the counter , then find a seat with your number and wait for your meal type place . people were friendly and service was good ( for what it was ) . i would give it a try if i was in the area again .
DOC128 never eaten at this place before , but it 's always crowded and i decided that must mean something . i was running errands and had n't eaten the whole day , so decided to finally give this place a shot . i ordered a chicken sandwich and iced tea .  the iced tea does n't appear to be iced tea . it was a dark reddish colour and tasted like very watered down pomegranate juice . it was inedible . it was super gross . i was thinking that maybe they made a mistake , but i ca n't see on the menu anything else it might be and the girl who took my order , poured the drink and gave it to me said it was iced tea . sooooo ew .  sandwich was alright , but just alright . the `` aroma sauce '' which is a garlic mayo of sorts was good and the roasted red peppers and mozzerella on the sandwich were good . the bread was good , but the chicken was the sort of cheap , crappy chicken you find at subway , where it 's a sort of compressed chicken-like white meat , with fake grill marks on it . it had no taste and really took away from the overall sandwich .  there are soups , salads and of course hot beverages served at this place as well , so i 'm not writing it off just yet , but this was not a good first impression .
DOC129 solid soup place ... has an ever-so-slightly sketchy vibe to it ... you order your soup and the woman disappears into the back ... usually closes the sliding window so you ca n't see back there and then eventually emerges with your soup . also seems to sell a selection of jamaican movies in dvd from a glass case ... sort of random .  generous with the veggies , less so with dumplings , but all the soups have great flavour and are decently sized for the price . i wish they would offer some bread or crackers for the soup ... would be a nice , easy add-on . but this place is what it is and does n't bother with the bells and whistles . really deserves a 3.5 stars . the red bean is my fav by far .
DOC130 i would be more inclined to give this place 3-1\/2 stars , but since that 's not possible , i 'm rounding down .  i went here for sunday lunch with a group for winterlicious . for $ 15 we got a choice of appetizer , entree and dessert .  we arrived first and our table was waiting for us . the restaurant was not busy at that point and our waiter was very attentive with water and the wine menu .  once our party finally arrived we all ordered . i had their chipotle sweet potato & goat cheese dip , which was average . the salads looked much better and got better reviews . same with the soup . the dip was literally a dollap of dip at the side of the plate with some crostinis on the other end and 1 piece of pickled cauliflower and a few slices of onion in the middle . the dip was good , the pickled cauliflower alright . it was nice when all combined on the crostini ( pickled veggies , dip on top of crostini ) .  i had originally wanted to order the double pork slider , but i saw it arrive at someone else 's table and it was literally just the one , single mini pork sandwich , with a few thinly cut fries at the side . it looked good , but it was appetizer size , if that . the chicken sandwich was more reasonably sized , so i ordered that . it was good . i really liked the bread . the macaroni was also more reasonably sized . i sampled it and it was fine . did n't blow me away .  dessert was the highlight of the meal for everyone i think . some people ordered the mousse , which i thought was fine , but the people who ordered it loved , so there you have it . my husband loved his apple terrine , which i tried and was good . i liked the flavour of my creme brule very much , but the top was over toasted and had hardened to the consistency of a thin , hard candy . it was hard to break with my spoon and got stuck in my teeth .  the service was consistently good , so no complaints there . none of us had wine with our lunch ( although some had other drinks ) , so i ca n't comment there .  this is a tapas bar , so i expect sizes to be small . but when sizes are small i expect them to be priced accordingly and\/or to be in sharable portions . they gave the prices of each dish if you were to purchased them individually . these would all be hard to share and would n't really be worth it . they are nice as a winterlicious meal , but i 'm not sure this would be my first choice to go back to .
DOC131 i am surprised at the people complaining about the service , because we found the service to be fine . especially given how busy and cramped it was . there were no tables , but they got us seats at the bar . the music was maybe a little loud , but i enjoyed the 90s throwback that was happening . the place looks like a dive , it 's a total hole in the wall , with no signs to speak of , but i liked the weird atmosphere of weird , old `` ghetto blasters '' on the walls and pics of arnold in terminator . it 's random , just go with it ... but the food ... .oh the food ! we were told that the squash poutine was a must have , so i ordered that and the bulgogi cheese steak , while my friend ordered the poutine and the mackerel . the mackerel was served first . it arrived raw , on a platter and a torch was taken to it to sear the outside and that was it . my friend allowed me a bite and it was so fresh tasting , with a delicious marinade . next came by bulgogi sandwich . fresh , delicious bread and amazing bulgogi . was very pleased . finally the `` poutines '' arrived . i should say that it was not what we were expecting . i assumed it would be squash on top of fries . but in fact the squash was the fries . they were lightly fried and covered in a variety of sauce `` gravies '' and scallions and some other stuff that i could neither make out , nor even see clearly ( dim lighting ) . it does n't matter okay ... .this stuff was heaven ! both my friend and i took a bite and looked at each other ... and proclaimed our new favourite food . other people in our party got the wings , which looked amazing and they said they were and the loosey , which was also proclaimed as delicious . so basically there were no wrong moves . the drink menu was very adventurous ... more so than we were , because we did n't take the plunge , although it was fun sitting at the bar and watching the bartender creating them . and splitting the bill for my friend with two others ( her birthday ) , my two `` tapas '' and a generic alcoholic beverage came to just under $ 30 . the prices are extremely reasonable ... and honestly once you try this stuff ... i mean , i do n't want to give them any ideas , but i would have paid more for that fine , fine food . i will be back . need me some more of that poutine !
DOC132 our friends got the groupon for four people and took us along . i 'm very pleased we went ! having never had ethiopian food before , we were curious , but wary . the deal really helped us dive in . it included two appetizers , four main courses and two desserts . we started with two appetizers , one i was n't a huge fan of ( a `` salad '' with a strong vinegar taste and jalapenos , which i found too strong , although other people in my group really liked it ) . the other appetizer was similar to an indian samosa ( similar name too , but i ca n't remember exactly what it was called ) . they were stuff with lentils and had a flaky shell . they were delicious . but , their appetizers were only made for three people , so there were only three of them ! seems silly when you offer a four person deal . we each ordered a different main course and they brought them on one large platter , so we could all share . we ordered two vegetarian options , one of lentils and one of chickpeas and one of chicken and one of beef . basically , the meals are more sauces than anything and they are served with injera , which are sort of bland , cold , bread-like stuff , which comes rolled up . they 're nothing special , but they 're only used as a sort of utensil , because you use it to scoop up the food . the food was delicious ! i especially liked the chickpea dish . every one of us ended up liking a different dish the best ! worked out well . i personally found the beef dish very tough though . once we were stuff with the food , we ordered two desserts . we especially liked the cheesecake ( which is obviously not ethiopian ) . we asked if they had any ethiopian coffees and they said yes . they showed us the beans , as they were being roasted . then they came back out with a sort of stone earthenware kettle and some small cups . the coffee was so rich , it was almost like chocolate . they also served it with a large basket of popcorn , which was just perfectly prepared . it was such a nice after dinner snack ! i would totally come here just to order the coffee ! it would have been a very expensive dinner without the groupon , so i 'm not sure i would make this a regularly destination , but as i said , the coffee was fantastic and it 's a fun thing to try , especially with friends . make sure they 're good ones , that you do n't mind getting messy in front of !
DOC133 a little on the pricey end for baked goods , but the baked goods are good . also their coffee products are great . the set up is annoying ( order your desserts on one side and coffee and food on another side ) , but the service is good and overall they do a good job .
DOC134 my sister told me that origin was well known for their delicious brunches , so we made a trip there to see if this was the case . origin is pretty new in our area and is very large , but nicely decorated . my only comment would be the washrooms , which feature communal sinks , the kind you find in elementary schools , where you step on the thing at the bottom and water comes out all around . besides not being very effective to quickly wash hands , it 's also wasteful if you 're the only one there . strange concept . throw back , but not necessarily one wants to remember during their brunch . now onto the important part ... the food and service . service started out alright and then immediately got very slow . it took some time to get our drink orders and then took a long time to get our actual orders . i ordered their french toast , my sister ordered tostada and my husband skipped brunch and ordered a meal they offered of a burger , fries covered in some chorizo and sauce and a float . i also ordered a side of bacon ... and was told that they were out of bacon ... which meant any orders that would have come with bacon were out entirely , or would be served without bacon . i 'm sorry but a brunch restaurant without bacon ? even the waitress admitted it was ridiculous . we also shared a plate of buscuits with their preserves . these were delicious . apparently my meal was the one that took the longest . the others got their food and we still waited for five minutes before mine came out . who knew it would take so long to put a couple of pieces of bread on a plate and cover them with blueberry preserves ? my sister said her tostada was quite good . my french toast was nothing special . the toast was `` fancy '' , rounded pieces , on top of each other with whipped cream and blueberries in between . the `` maple '' which was supposed to be on the plate ( maple syrup i 'm guessing ) was barely present . tasted like something i could have created with some ease . my husband 's dish was the best by far . his burger was juicy and this fries were great . the float was a little silly ... this big , meaty burger and fries covered in more meat ... paired with a cream soda float in pink and white layers . ( not insulting , we just got a laugh ) . nothing was cheap and then we had to wait a long time again to get our bill and pay . this was all strange because the restaurant was not particularly busy . because the brunch itself did n't blow me away , food shortages and service , i 'm not sure if i would bother with brunch again . oliver and bonicini in the actual mall has a much better brunch . i might try this again for lunch or dinner though .
DOC135 the saga has finished ... .because i needed to end this bs and move on .  so first off , the store owner responded to my complaints ... by blaming me . apparently it is my fault they sent the wrong thing , because i sent an email and then followed it up with a phone call ... which confused them and made them think there were two orders or something . which makes zero sense , because two orders were not sent . and the person i was speaking with on the phone responded to the emails i sent with codes to try out ... .so i have a hard time believing that they were confused by what was going on and thought that the phone order and email order were different .  they also told me they blocked me on instagram because i was body shaming their models . i want to be very clear on this . i never once body shamed , or made any comments on instagram about their models . i asked why they were promoting clothing they do n't even have in stock on instagram ... apparently that equates to body shaming to them .  they also informed me that because they had to mail so many orders to me ( 3 ) , they were going to start to charge me for shipping . they seemed to forget that i had also been paying to ship items back to them and that i had specifically chosen times when they had free shipping promos taking place to place orders . it 's not that they were n't charging me for shipping ... it was that i was taking advantage of their own promos . apparently i ca n't use their promos anymore , because they have placed an arbitrary rules on how many times you can make a return now . at least for me .  they did not address the code not working .  i responded and expressed continued frustration at their lack of ownership over their mistakes and how poor their customer service continued to be .  then i did some research and sent another email . instead of returning the dress i would donate it to dress for success . i said this seemed like a better choice than continuing to mail clothing back and forth . my request to them was that they take the would be money they would spend on continuing to mail me clothing and take some ownership for their mistakes and channel it into something good . i asked that they take the remaining $ 9.98 credit i had and put it towards them making a small donation , either monetarily or a piece of clothing , also to the charity . i stated that their continued neglect for customer service and lack of ownership over repeated problems should be owned up to , but if they would n't do it for me , perhaps they would be willing to do so for someone in need . i said that would conclude our business and bring something good out of this ridiculousness .  a few hours later i received an email with a letter of thanks for a donation made to dress for success ... for the amount of $ 10 via the store ... .so my remainder amount i had paid for and big sis closet 's contribution of ... .two cents . their generosity is astounding . now , i do n't know that they have n't made their own donation and just not told me of course ... i 'll let you guys decide whether you want to give them the benefit of the doubt in that regard . but given that they have taken zero responsibility for the continued poor management and customer service , well ... i think you can guess what my thoughts are on the subject . no further correspondence was sent from the actual store .  but at any rate , i am donating the new dress to dress for success ( along with my $ 9.98 ) and i am officially done with this store for good . and i sincerely hope that people read this review and think twice about shopping here . the clothes are not good quality , but more than that ... i have never experienced such insanely bad management and customer service in my life . zero regard for their customers , zero regard for their own mistakes , zero regard for taking ownership of ... anything ! just excuse after excuse and then turning the blame around on their customers . these people do not deserve your business and quite frankly ... ladies you deserve better . better clothing ( i have now purchased 6 items and been dissatisfied with the quality of all of them ... loose threads , flimsy , cheap fabric , wrong stitching for the fabric , no lining , incorrect fit for size , etc . ) and a greater degree of respect as a consumer .
DOC136 went here with my sister and her boyfriend for some drinks . we were hungry and ordered a few appetizers to share . drinks were fine ( my mix drink was on the very small side ) , but the food was really good . the perogies and `` chips '' and dip were excellent . the service was good and the atmosphere was nice , for such a small place . bathrooms were also nice , clean , etc . only problem is that some of the tables are so small , it 's really hard to use them . we were at a very small one and even though we fit around it alright , a guy walking by knocked a beer over with his coat and it dumped all down me . i mean all over me . it 's not the bar 's fault the guy knocked the glass , but if the table was a bit bigger we would have had more room to put the glass further in , so it would n't have gotten knocked in the first place . the fact is , if you 're going to serve food people need a place to put it . a few slightly bigger tables would go a long way .
DOC121 after being scared away from rock & rita 's , we ended up at this place , which was , if nothing else , quieter .  i 'll start by saying that the hostess and our server were both lovely and they 're really what earned the single star , because they were sweet , but the food was just horrible .  i ordered a simple grilled cheese sandwich . i asked the server if it was processed cheese , or `` real '' cheese in the sandwich and he had no idea what i was talking about . i tried to clarify by saying , `` is it like kraft single slices , or deli cheese ? '' he said it was `` good '' . this really should have been a sign and i could probably fault the waiter for this , since you should know what you 're serving , but he was so sweet , i could n't be mad !  my husband ordered a hot dog of sorts .  i asked if there was a way to substitute fries for a salad . there was not , but the server hooked me up and brought me a salad anyway ( no charge ) . i asked for sweet potato fries with the sandwich .  of course , my sandwich was made with plasticy , processed cheese , that was melted to the point of cheeze-wiz and was inedible . i took one bite of the sandwich and could n't do another . i got regular fries , instead of sweet potato ( did n't bother complaining , because i got the free salad , so whatever ... like i said , nice server ! ) my husband 's food was fine , although nothing special . they were good with the refills of our drinks .  anyway , as nice as the servers were , it was n't good . i would avoid eating here if i could .
DOC122 we got recommendations for this place from my parents and so , for our anniversary , we booked here . we were told though that it was first come , first served , in terms of having the ideal seats by the windows that overlook the fountains of the bellagio and the strip . we went for lunch though , so it was n't too busy . we were seated by the window and were promptly served some sort of puffed rolls , with cheese and herbs infused . they were delicious !  we ordered the onion soup to start and i ordered parmesan chicken and my husband ordered a lamb burger . our food came and was delicious . the soup was probably my favorite part . we were feeling very full by the end and so declined dessert , but were still given some jellies and chocolate truffle and then were served a small chocolate mousse , on a decorated plate that said happy anniversary , which was a total surprise ( they had asked when i booked if it was a special occasion , but had said nothing while we were there ) . overall the service was great , the food delicious and the view wonderful . it was a great experience !
DOC123 i went here for the first time yesterday night to celebrate something with my family . several members of my family have been to this place before for summerlicious and really enjoyed it .  a nice atmosphere and excellent service , everyone ordered a variety of different dishes , many of which i tasted . i myself had a chicken salad and thought it was very good . my sister 's pasta dish was amazing though ! our waiter never rushed us out and was quick to refill water and bread and clear dishes , etc . that with an arm brace on !  prices are a little high , which is why i did n't give this place five stars ... i know those amazing places exist out there with great food and great prices , but this was a nice evening out .

DOC129 solid soup place ... has an ever-so-slightly sketchy vibe to it ... you order your soup and the woman disappears into the back ... usually closes the sliding window so you ca n't see back there and then eventually emerges with your soup . also seems to sell a selection of jamaican movies in dvd from a glass case ... sort of random .  generous with the veggies , less so with dumplings , but all the soups have great flavour and are decently sized for the price . i wish they would offer some bread or crackers for the soup ... would be a nice , easy add-on . but this place is what it is and does n't bother with the bells and whistles . really deserves a 3.5 stars . the red bean is my fav by far .
DOC130 i would be more inclined to give this place 3-1\/2 stars , but since that 's not possible , i 'm rounding down .  i went here for sunday lunch with a group for winterlicious . for $ 15 we got a choice of appetizer , entree and dessert .  we arrived first and our table was waiting for us . the restaurant was not busy at that point and our waiter was very attentive with water and the wine menu .  once our party finally arrived we all ordered . i had their chipotle sweet potato & goat cheese dip , which was average . the salads looked much better and got better reviews . same with the soup . the dip was literally a dollap of dip at the side of the plate with some crostinis on the other end and 1 piece of pickled cauliflower and a few slices of onion in the middle . the dip was good , the pickled cauliflower alright . it was nice when all combined on the crostini ( pickled veggies , dip on top of crostini ) .  i had originally wanted to order the double pork slider , but i saw it arrive at someone else 's table and it was literally just the one , single mini pork sandwich , with a few thinly cut fries at the side . it looked good , but it was appetizer size , if that . the chicken sandwich was more reasonably sized , so i ordered that . it was good . i really liked the bread . the macaroni was also more reasonably sized . i sampled it and it was fine . did n't blow me away .  dessert was the highlight of the meal for everyone i think . some people ordered the mousse , which i thought was fine , but the people who ordered it loved , so there you have it . my husband loved his apple terrine , which i tried and was good . i liked the flavour of my creme brule very much , but the top was over toasted and had hardened to the consistency of a thin , hard candy . it was hard to break with my spoon and got stuck in my teeth .  the service was consistently good , so no complaints there . none of us had wine with our lunch ( although some had other drinks ) , so i ca n't comment there .  this is a tapas bar , so i expect sizes to be small . but when sizes are small i expect them to be priced accordingly and\/or to be in sharable portions . they gave the prices of each dish if you were to purchased them individually . these would all be hard to share and would n't really be worth it . they are nice as a winterlicious meal , but i 'm not sure this would be my first choice to go back to .
