DOC0 super simple place but amazing nonetheless . it 's been around since the 30 's and they still serve the same thing they started with : a bologna and salami sandwich with mustard .  staff was very helpful and friendly .
DOC1 small unassuming place that changes their menu every so often . cool decor and vibe inside their 30 seat restaurant . call for a reservation .  we had their beef tartar and pork belly to start and a salmon dish and lamb meal for mains . everything was incredible ! i could go on at length about how all the listed ingredients really make their dishes amazing but honestly you just need to go .  a bit outside of downtown montreal but take the metro out and it 's less than a 10 minute walk from the station .
DOC2 lester 's is located in a beautiful neighborhood and has been there since 1951 . they are known for smoked meat which most deli 's have but their brisket sandwich is what i come to montreal for . they 've got about 12 seats outside to go along with the inside .  the smoked meat is up there in quality and taste with schwartz 's and you 'll find less tourists at lester 's as well .
DOC3 love coming here . yes the place always needs the floor swept but when you give out peanuts in the shell how wo n't it always be a bit dirty .  the food speaks for itself , so good . burgers are made to order and the meat is put on the grill when you order your sandwich . getting the small burger just means 1 patty , the regular is a 2 patty burger which is twice the deliciousness .  getting the cajun fries adds a bit of spice to them and whatever size you order they always throw more fries ( a lot more fries ) into the bag .
DOC4 had their chocolate almond croissant and it was amazing ! so light and buttery and oh my how chocolaty .  if you 're looking for a light breakfast then head out here . perfect spot for a coffee\/latt√© before heading out to the old port
DOC5 cycle pub las vegas was a blast ! got a groupon and rented the bike for 11 of us for an afternoon tour . each bar was more fun than the last . downtown las vegas has changed so much and for the better . we had a wide age range in this group from early 20 's to mid 50 's and everyone had so much fun ! our driver tony was knowledgable , friendly and just plain fun ! would recommend this to anyone looking to do something different away from the strip . you wo n't be disappointed !
DOC6 who would have guess that you would be able to get fairly decent vietnamese restaurant in east york ?  not quite the same as chinatown in terms of pricing ( slightly higher ) but definitely one of the better vietnamese restaurants outside of the neighbourhood . when i do n't have time to go to chinatown , this is the next best thing as it is down the street from me .  so far the only items i have tried are the phos ( beef , chicken & vegetarian ) - and they have not disappointed me ! especially the chicken pho .  next time i go back , i 'm going to try the banh cuon ( steamed rice noodle ) and the vermicelli !
DOC7 always drove past this coffee house and wondered about it . bf and i finally made the stop to try this place out .  cute , quaint coffee shop with nice muskoka chairs outside .  bf ordered an ice coffee and really enjoyed it ! guess we will be back again !
DOC8 not bad ! ! love that there is a gluten-free , vegan version of the cheese curds and gravy ! !  have n't done the poutine taste test yet with smoke 's but im excited to see which is better . however poutini 's might win as they are vegan and gluten-free
DOC9 love this place !  peggy is great with dogs and does a great job ! she is very patience with him and will make any adjustments you need before you leave the store . my little guy has no problems coming here .  they also have very good bully sticks ( the non-smelly ones ) that my little guy and his friends love !
DOC10 this is currently my parents new favourite restaurant .  we come here in the morning for dim sum . they are not the cart pushing type of dim sum , it is order off of the sheet . dim sum is not bad and not expensive either .  we also frequent the dinner scene . their set dinner menu is not bad . we typically order a 6 dish menu and it 's big enough to feed a family of 9 with leftovers .  overall , food is pretty tasty !
DOC11 server was a little rude .  ordered the calamari , duck confit poutine and the trout fish with miso soba - all very tasty . definitely not your typical diner .
DOC12 i thought tidy 's flowers had a great reputation as a florist , but i guess i was wrong !  for valentine 's day my boyfriend had ordered roses with tidy 's . however , the flowers that were delivered was not what he had ordered . he had placed in an order for long stem roses , mixed with orchids and was charged for that . what had showed up was a small vase with 4 short cut roses and some greens - table ornament , not really valentine 's day flowers .  in speaking with another friend , something similar happened to her - her fiancee had ordered a dozen of roses for her for valentine 's day while he was in germany as a surprise and they never showed up . so when he called them to complaint , they actually then called up my friend to confirm whether or not she had received the flowers . which she did n't , so they said they would resend - only to have them deliver it to the wrong place .  understanding that valentine 's day is the most busiest day for florists and mistakes do happen , the way they had handled it was not what would have been expected from a florist of that nature .
DOC13 wanted to check out this place due to all the hype i had heard . my friend wanted to come here for her birthday . we had a group of seven and based on the way the seating works ( as it is communal ) , we wind up sharing with another group of five .  food was ok - not sure what the hype was . almost 75 % of the dishes had some sort of cheese in it .  this place is very loud so not ideal for catching up\/talking . not a great place to go if you have any gluten or vegan restrictions .  interesting concept . would definitely recommend to try this place once - but definitely not worth the 30- 45 mins wait .
DOC14 this place is awesome ! definitely authentic ! ! !  my two favourite dishes are the rice flour rolls and the chicken pho . the rice flour rolls are always fresh whenever i 'm there ! and the chicken pho is always flavourful ! ! mmmm ... .just thinking of it makes me want some !  my boyfriend is vietnamese and he agrees that this place is authentic and one of the best vietnamese restaurants he has ever eaten at .  prices are very reasonable too !
DOC15 a must stop when you are in montreal !  i was in mtl for the weekend and wind up eating here 2 nights in a row !  the sandwiches here are unbelieveable ! the smoked meat is so tasty and salty but so good . the bread definitely complements the meat !  not much of a line up if you come either later in the evening .  remember to leave a tip in the plate when you order take out and the servers will be extra nice and funny !
DOC16 i too have been trying to book an appt to use my voucher - it 's been months and countless of phone calls - no response yet .  agree with the buyers beware warning . i only wish reviews on this place was posted previous to my purchase of this voucher .
DOC17 came here with my girlfriends one sunday afternoon . this place will take a long time to serve your food - as it took them almost an hour to give us our food . so make sure you give yourself lots of time ! it is definitely a lazy brunch place !  definitely recommend the pancakes ! beware of the portion sizes - they are huge !
DOC18 came here for a burger as one of my friends said they had good burgers and people from work would come by twice a month for a burger run .  ordered the original was was ok , was n't as amazing as everyone says it to be . i think the veggie option would have been better .  a little pricy for a take-out burger .
DOC19 really excited to hear of this restaurant coming to toronto . when it finally opened , my friend and i were really excited to try this place .  service here is not great , it felt like they had forgotten about us and that they did n't care about the service as everything came out one at a time . my friend and i had each ordered a ginger beer , which came out at two separate times ( it was almost as if they had to go in the back and make it themselves - that 's how long it took ) .  there is absolutely no vegetarian options , except for the one cold noodle - the mushroom bun is not vegetarian .  the pork belly bun was nothing special - just a piece of meat with the bun . for my vegetarian friend , we had ordered the bun plain so she could experience it as well , and they literally just gave it to us plain , with no sauce , no kimchi .  the momofuko ramen was awful . it was bland and mushy . after a few bites , i could n't handle eating anymore .  momofuko is not the place to go if you want real ramen . i 've had better experience with instant noodles .
DOC20 was always intrigued of this place when i pass by on the streetcar . finally decided to try this place out this past summer . read the reviews and everyone had lots of good things to say .  one of my friends has dietary restrictions and needs to have gluten-free items . when i had called to make the dinner reservation , i had asked and the hostess said , yes , we do have gluten-free items that are not just salads . just let the server know when you come in .  excited to find another gluten-free place in town , my friends and i show up for the reservation . upon arrival , the server was really nice and friendly . when we had asked about the gluten-free options , the answer was unfortunately as we do not cook our foods separately , the only gluten-free items are salads . which was a disppointment to us , as we had specifically asked if there were gluten-free items that were n't salads on the menu .  so we decided to just order a couple of apps and drinks as we have been sitting there for quite some time , and it was n't the server 's fault that there was n't any gluten-free items ( we felt bad to just get up and leave ) .  in reading the reviews , everyone thought very highly of the mac and cheese and poutine , we had ordered that to try . it was n't bad , but not sure what the hype was about . definitely pretty rich and filling and made for sharing !
DOC21 this place reminds of st lawrence market in toronto but more veggies and fruits then seafood .  fruits and veggies look so good ! too bad we did n't have a kitchen at our hotel room , cause we would have bought and cooked up a storm ! !  lots of varieties of apples !
DOC22 burgers are very big portions here .  definitely order the onion ring tower to share ...  milkshakes are tasty ! my personal favourite - the vanilla one .
DOC23 food is very bland - not authentic at all .  meant to cater to the customers who have never eaten vietnamese food before .  definitely will not be returning !
DOC24 while looking at different restaurants in the area , came upon this restaurant posting and decided to try it , as it is down the street from work .  not bad when you want something slightly cheaper than congee star . it is a mix of chinese and choy suey menu .
DOC25 service is really slow here . i waited for over 25 mins just for takeout . definitely not worth the wait . however , they seem to have live music friday nites , so if you are looking for entertainment and food sit-in is probably a lot faster
DOC26 a few years ago , this used to be the place to be for bunch . i was really excited to take my boyfriend here to experience one of the `` must visit places in mtl '' . boy were we disappointed !  we had ordered the eggspectation omelette and eggs benedict . the omelette was bland , overcooked . the eggs benedict were ok , but i 've had better . the portion size has come down .  overall , food and service has gone downhill and not worth my time anymore .
DOC27 omg - definitely worth going if you are in montreal ! !  and remember to eat it fresh - it is amazing paired with an organic cream cheese . mmmm ... .
DOC28 not sure what the hype is , but decided to give this a try based on all the reviews .  maybe it was too hyped up , but it was n't as amazing as i thought it would be . maybe it was what we had ordered , but it was just ok. we had ordered the kimchi fries , which was kind of like a ny fries `` the works '' . the grilled pork banh mi was ok .  will be back to try other stuff , like the bao version and the pork belly .
DOC29 love the selection of winter gear here for my little one !  we are a big fan of the canadan pooch line and they carry a variety of jackets and sweaters here . and it 's not just for big dogs - they have different sizes to fit all different size dogs .  good selection of treats and food as well !
DOC30 hidden on the east end of the danforth is a lovely thai restaurant . found this restaurant while surfing on yelp .  surprisingly this place is pretty big to seat a big group of 12 and still have a few more small tables available . they are mainly a take-out restaurant , as many of the customers came in for take-out , and the service was a little bit slow . however , the food was great and it accommodating for many different people - seafood lovers , vegans , etc .  definitely recommend the basil fried rice and the fried sole fish with eggplant but for those curry lovers out there , stay away from the roti curry chicken - no curry taste , just coconut favour . but the roti itself was really good .  most of the dishes were under $ 10 - definitely a good deal !  will be back to try the noodle dishes !
DOC31 if you have not yet tried wasabi - do n't bother .  it 's expensive and the food is disgusting . you have to order the sushi at the table , but everything else ( i.e . salads , soups , cooked food ) you can get up and go get it yourself .  the food is very bland , the sushi does not taste like anything - not even sure if the fish is fresh .  on the weekends , everyone seems to be there for the snow crab legs - if that 's what you are coming for , forget it ! you have to fight\/wait in-line to get it . it 's probably easier to eat it at mandarin .  if anyone suggests to go there , i highly recommend you go somewhere else !
DOC32 decided to try this place after reading the reviews . was not disappointed . huge portions and a bit of a long wait . they will take phone orders over the walk ins . so call ahead to order !  tried the burrito with rice but will be back to try the noodle version ! !
DOC33 great place to bring dogs ! it 's really a dog place that you bring your humans : p  as soon as we walked in , my dog was greeted with treats ! he was so excited to explore the store ...  there are 4 seats that you can sit and have your coffee while your dog lounges in the dog bed in front of you .  truth - this really a store for dogs , not so much for humans even though they offer coffee and tea - but just a handful of choices , nothing crazy : )  the great part is my dog is very picky when it comes to his treats and he really likes the one we had purchased here . guess we will be back for more ...
DOC34 hidden in the east end of the danforth , who knew there would be a little ethiopian community ?  the decor is definitely interesting . although , the outside has lots of lights as decoration , the inside is kind of dark . the red lighting and orange menu makes it hard to read .  the food is not bad . although they tell you that the vegetarian platter is only for one person - this platter is definitely made for sharing !
DOC35 this review is mainly for the pool only .  love that it has a nice indoor salt water pool for the doggies to use . it is small , and only meant for 1 dog at a time . i have a small little one that makes this size work well for him , but not sure how the bigger dogs can really swim in here .  the pool is great as the water is lukewarm so my little guy is willing to go in ( as we have been to another indoor pool which the water is cold ) .  for the 1st time users , they have an instructor there to help assess what your dog can do or not do , that way you do n't scared them off from swimming .  after that , you are free to book time for just you and your pup .  and they have a tub outside of the pool to bath them when they are done .  overall , no complaints with them !
DOC36 it 's 3.5 stars but since i ca n't give half stars i will give it four .  cute shop love the concept !  lots of varieties of cookie but pretty pricy ! there are probably about 10 varieties cookies and about seven milk flavours . the banana flavoured milk reminds us of the banana cough syrup we used to drink as a kid !  they do have homemade cookie ice cream sandwiches but the cookie is on the thinner side .
DOC37 great place in chinatown to get banh mi ! just make sure you know what you want as it is really crazy in there and hectic ! the ladies behind the counter will harass you until you move along !  lots of great prepacked food as well , if the sandwich is n't your thing !
DOC38 very busy place here on a friday night . definitely has a queen street feel with the decor .  food is a little pricey but not bad . shrimp tempura appetizer is a good size for sharing . sweet potato wedges are well paired with the wasabi mayo .  rolls are very good . they have a different pink dragon roll that has scallops on the top . green dragon rolls are definitely a must try . the avocado is very thinly sliced sprinkled with something yummy on top .
DOC39 cute place on a side street - really only serving the locals around the woodbine\/danforth area .  bf ordered a coffee here that he thought was pretty good . they seem to have smoothies and fresh juices as well . and nifty rice bowls .  will be back to try out the juices and food .  seems to be a quiet place to chill for a couple of hours .
DOC40 atmosphere for this restaurant is nice but service , not so much .  came here for a friend 's birthday . although , we made reservations and checked in a few minutes early , we still had to wait a good 45 minutes before sitting down at our table . when we made the reservations , we were informed we would have to leave a certain time - which we did n't think they would enforce , considering we did not get our table in time . however , they did , and we were not impressed .  the space in the restaurant is also very tight , my boyfriend got hit in the head a few times while sitting at the table .  i had ordered a seafood pasta dish , which was kind of bland ( not much flavour ) . my boyfriend had ordered one of the specials of the night - filet mignon , which also was not up to par .  overall , i 've had better pasta . i 'm not sure if it was just the two dishes i had that was n't up to par , as my other friends did enjoy theirs .
DOC41 the loud banging always draws crowds as you walk by and see that the chef is making fresh noodles . noodles are delicious and you definitely need to make sure you save room in your stomach for this when you come to pacific mall !  after trying a few things on the menu - the true favourite is still the dan dan noodles . there is something about the spicy peanut sauce soup base that makes it so flavourful . plus when you add their homemade chili oil - it makes it so good .  because of sun 's dan dan noodles - my bf and i will always order the dan fan noodle whenever we see it on the menu but so far , no one has the same flavour as sun 's . sun 's is the best we have had ! ! !
DOC42 found this bakery while wandering on queen street - it was hidden on a side street .  walked inside to check it out and it was very quaint inside . lots of variety . we had gotten a loaf of brioche bread - it was so good . soft and sweet - just the way it should be .  they have lots of other bread that i ca n't wait to go back and try !
DOC43 terrible service and not so great drinks .  we happen to be in the plaza and saw this place for bubble tea , so we decided to grab a few to go .  first of all , the two menus is located in a very awkward place ( one very high up on the wall and one in the corner also by the wall ) , set up is not really friendly neither can it accommodate a large group of people to look at the menu at the same time .  the menu items itself had different options than your typically bubble tea place . their specialty are mousse drinks - which we had no idea what exactly it was . so when we asked the staff , they said it was some sort of cheese .  for a sunday afternoon , they were also out of grass jelly and pudding , which are ingredients in quite a few of their drinks ( so not sure how that works ) .  the service is really bad , they do n't understand english so when you asked them about the menu items , they ca n't really explain what they are .  we had ordered the following : - slush mango ( came with tapioca and mousse ) - peach ice tea - roasted oolong milk tea - supernova kumquat lemonade  and when we asked what the difference between a supernova kumquat lemonade under the galaxy drinks section ( which are supposed to be layered drinks ) , and the kumquat lemonade , they said it had a layer of blue mousse - so we were like ok we will try it then . but what came was just a bigger cup size of the kumquat lemonade . when we asked them again , they said it was just a size difference , that 's what makes it supernova - which is pretty dumb to me as on the menu both items had the same two size choices of regular or large .  the mango slush and the roasted oolong milk tea was n't bad . but the other two was not that great . the tea had a big floral taste that overpowered everything . there was no peach taste in the peach ice tea . the kumquat one had no kumquat taste and was just bitter from the lime and it tasted like it had no sugar in it at all .  i guess if you need a non-busy place to use wifi and work , then this is the place , no one wants to come here .  also - their gimmick also seems to be the lightbulb drinks , which were intriguing to us , but you are not allowed to take the lightbulb home ...  we will definitely not be returning ...
DOC44 worse customer service ever . manager on duty was rude . she did n't care that i had negative feelings about this place when i said that i would never come back again ! restaurant has gone downhill since they renovated ! !
DOC45 my boyfriend took me here for my birthday . at first , i was n't impress that it was a 45 mins wait , however my bf really wanted to try this piece , so we decided to wait .  it was definitely different and worth the wait .  we started off with the house cured meat - it was good - but definitely too much for just 2 people to share ( and no need to order the extra bread if it 's only two people ) .  next came the roasted bone marrow - which is amazing and definitely worth ordering . had we not ordered so many other dishes , we would have ordered a second round of this . who knew bone marrow could be this tasty ! !  then came the spicy horse tartare , which we thought was intriguing , as we have never heard , so we had ordered it . when it showed up , it was like a salad . was n't bad , worth trying but probably only a one-time thing for us .  tongue on brioche is definitely another worth ordering . it is a sandwich that tasted like a montreal smoked meat sandwich . so good that it melts in your mouth - so soft and tender . if it was n't because we had ordered so much food and this was the last main course that showed up , we would have devoured it .  for dessert , we had ordered the foie and nutella , as we thought this was very interesting . it was good , but after 4 dishes already , this was just a little too rich . it came with banana bread that was really good .  overall , definitely worth the try ! just make sure you bring cash = )
DOC46 omg - came here with some friends for brunch and wow !  we did have to wait for about 30 mins for a table for 4 ( but it was later in the day ) .  looking at their menu , we wanted to try everything ! the french toast , the strawberry shortcakes..donuts ( they were sold out by the time we got there ) .  but we wind up only ordering two things :  the classic - 2 eggs any style , house cured bacon or sage and onion sausage , crispy griddled red skin potatoes with sea salt and thyme . served with toast of your choice . upgrade your toast to a buttermilk biscuit  emma 's benny - warm and fluffy buttermilk biscuit topped with house cured peameal bacon , poached eggs and smothered in mousselline sauce . served with a side of griddled red skin potatoes .  big portions - really good !  if you want the benny , make sure you asked them if they still have it as they tend to sell out quick - i had ordered the last one of the day ! ! !
DOC47 great japanese restaurant in the bloor and church area . been coming here since the first opened years ago .  food has always been good and fresh . however , if you are here for lunch , it will take an hour and make sure you come a few minutes earlier otherwise it may be a long wait as it is small inside !
DOC48 they have some pretty interesting things here !  definitely a one-stop shop for cheese and bread =p  also carry a variety of pates that are pretty tasty !
DOC49 love this place !  the cakes are delicious but really rich ! they have cute cupcakes and lots of macaroons .  the best part - they now have a gluten free chocolate cake - which hubby and i think is better than the regular cake !
DOC50 it 's a pub ... nice and clean one .  came here to grab some food with the girls since the thai place below was an hour wait . we stuck with the normal pub food : burgers , fries and grilled cheese sandwich .  the burger presentation was great - it comes with fries and some onion rings piled on top . it was a decent burger .  girlfriend got the grilled cheese sandwich with bacon - which she said was good .  when looking at the menu - there are so many options to choose from ... especially with the pictures they include . the only thing is the pictures always look better then the real thing . the sheppard 's pie looked so yummy but when we saw another table get it , it did n't look so appealing .
DOC51 cute little hole in the wall place . two entrances , one by a side street by an apartment building and the other side of the entrance in the mall .  they had lunch specials that are applicable on the weekend , so we ordered : - chirashi - salmon teriyaki - kalbi - chicken katsu - dynamic \/ california roll  all was very good and very fresh !  definitely recommend it and will be coming back !
DOC52 came here for dim sum - it 's one of those mark on a sheet to order .  the dim sum here is pretty decent and tasty . it can get a bit pricey , but other reviews say if you come early ( before 10:45am ) you can get all sizes for the same price .  definitely order from the dessert section - they have some pretty unique and tasty options .
DOC53 opened by pickle barrel , glow is meant to be this new healthy eating restaurant that ensures you do not over indulge on certain foods . they have burgers that are served bunless and a side of salad - so make sure you read the fine print prior to order to ensure you get what you want .  the food is ok , not memorable . the atmosphere and decor is beautiful . and the service was not bad - after hearing all the horror stories i thought we would be getting terrible service .  they also have these 100 calories shooter glass desserts that are cute , but also not memorable in taste .  i think this place is probably good for a drink ( for the atmosphere and decor ) , but not so much for their food .
DOC54 nice place by cumberland place . after we had sat down , we were given two huge blown up pitas . so we had ordered the eggplant dip to go with it . it had a nice smoked flavour to it but not even garlic taste for my liking so it was just a-ok .  ordered a chicken shawarma and a mango strawberry juice . the juice was yummy and would definitely order it again ! the shawarma - i 'm not sure about it . the meat was n't as tasty as i thought it would be . maybe i need to try the falafel instead next time .
DOC55 my sister loves this place ! probably comes by once a week , once every two weeks !  the hot pot for two is a great deal ! lots of food that can probably feed 3 ( assuming you are n't huge eaters - just regular eaters ) .  when it 's not hot pot time , my sister says they have really good hot stone bibimbap - which is what she typically gets .
DOC56 long line ups for sunday brunch - but so worth it !  the baked french toast is amazing ! ! very big portion though !  the butter tart was definitely the best butter tart i 've ever had .  note : it is a very small cafe , not good for large groups .
DOC57 stumbled upon this one day - thought i would give it a try .  typical sushi place - sushi was pretty good . price is decent .  party trays are decent . = )
DOC58 went with my friend as we had purchased the groupon back in april . before the groupon , reviews were pretty good for this place . but not sure if it is because of the amount of groupons they sold , their service and attitude has gone downhill .  we were a little late for our appt , but we had called ahead to notify them ( only to get the answering machine ) . when we got there , the receptionist was rude and said , typically we do n't take appts that are this late , as we are booked back to back , but this time we will take you in . and when we looked around the salon , there was only 2 other people getting their nails done .  the two girls that did our nails were really nice . my friend kept smudging her almost dried nails , so they had fixed it for her twice .  at the end of the day , we had to pay the $ 1.25 hst on top of the tips .  overall , we would not go back again .
DOC59 fish is good , really good . love how you could have so many different options for fish choices . chips is only ok. onion rings are not the same as the regular onions , a little too crispy .  i had ordered the house organic batter mahi mahi - very light , not really heavy . creamy coleslaw is flavourless . shared the o.t.h poutine which was ok but not for me . will go back to try the pull pork or duck confit one .  good for gluten free . = )
DOC60 after reading the reviews on yelp , my boyfriend and i decided to give this place a try , especially since we are on a mission to try ramen in every city we visit .  we were really excited , as when we were in nyc , we had really good ramen .  listening to the reviews we started off with the gyoza appetizer - which was not as good as everyone says it is . it was pan fried with the thin layer of skin , but there was an aftertaste of soap water . which i should have known , since the glass of water they served us was disgusting !  we had ordered the jumbo sumo ramen - beware , it is a very big bowl of noodles , which we did not expect .  the sumo ramen came with a half boil egg , seaweed , pork belly , and other veggies . the noodles and pork belly was good . soup was tasteless .  definitely would not go back again .
DOC61 came here for a friend 's birthday . she had looked it up and thought it sound good . first of all , when we made reservations , they only had a 7pm time slot for us ( we were looking for 8pm ) and when we were there , we were seated in the lower area of the restaurant , which was pretty empty .  there was an extensive menu , everything on the menu sound good , but when we got our food - there was nothing special , especially for what we paid for it .  the pizza 's are huge portions - so if you order it , make sure you share it .  there are 3 risottos on the menu , the seasonal vegetable one is the better one . some of the pastas were portioned differently , some were huge , others were tiny - so be careful !  the food came out really fast after we ordered , so fast , that some of the food was cold ( not sure if they make it in advance and just heat up afterwards ) . the desserts took forever to come .  at the end of the night when the bill came , there was a water service charge ( $ 12.50 ) for 9 people for just getting tap water . and 18 % gratuity after taxes .  atmosphere was good , but other than that i do not recommend this place at all .
DOC62 came here after dinner to meet up with some friends ... it was nice and roomy for 7 people .  we ordered a plate of rosemary fries to share , which was n't bad , however when served it was room temperature and did not taste like it just came out of the fryer .  bf had ordered a couple of beers , which he was not impressed at all with .
DOC63 wanted to give this place a try since it was in my neighbourhood and i would n't have to go far . came here for a late lunch on a friday - there was a few tables , but nothing crazy .  we had ordered :  - spicy miso ramen - salt broth ramen  they were ok - ca n't say there were great and ca n't say it was terrible . the noodles had a nice texture to it , a bit chewy and not too soft . but the broth was a bit bland - definitely lacking some depth to it like another reviewer had said .  looking at the menu , they definitely did have quite a few ramen options - perhaps too many options and they should try to narrow it down to make them better .  perhaps next time we should try the other menu items and not the ramen .
DOC64 decided to give this place a try based on the reviews .  service is really slow on a thursday afternoon work day . it took almost 30 mins before we got our food . definitely not the place to go during the work week .  ordered a pork bone soup which was just ok . nothing special or memorable about it .  not sure if i would come back again .
DOC65 this place is really good ! the best restaurant in the area ! the food there is really tasty - especially the ahi tuna club sandwich , lobster ravioli and the tandoori chicken flat bread .  they also have mock chicken for those who are vegetarians .  gorgeous patio for the summer time .
DOC66 decided to give this place a try since i was in the neighbourhood ! love that there was no line up at all . however , coming here at 5pm on saturday afternoon and only original flavour was left !  they have three flavours to choose from : original , chocolate and coffee .  my nephews loved it and thought it was better than uncle tetsu ( which i have not yet tried ) .
DOC67 small little japanese restaurant in the don mills neighbourhood . lots of different rolls to pick from .  great lunch special selection .  service is a little slow though . so if you only have 1 hour for lunch , may not be the best place . take out is pretty quick though .
DOC68 chinese version of cheesecake factory .  came here with a friend on a thursday night at 7:30pm and was told it was a 45 mins wait . my friend had walked by at 6pm to try to make a reservation in person but they said they would n't take it .  we wind up sitting at the bar to bypass the wait , as they serve the full menu at the bar as well .  nothing crazy different on the menu but the bartenders were really nice as we had sat there for over 2 hours .  we had ordered the crispy green beans which was really tasty . ma pao tofu which was weird that it was crispy tofu served on top of a bed of broccoli . vegetarian fried rice , ok but also served with a lot of broccoli .  will be back to try some of their noodle dishes .
DOC69 we were here on a holiday monday where nothing much was open . we had to grab some takeout as we were in a rush and this was the only place open .  we ordered : - beef noodle soup - grilled pork chop rice - grilled port vermicelli  the food was ok , nothing exciting and kind of bland .
DOC70 read about this bakery on blogto so decided to check it out since it was so close .  cute little place in the mid of chinatown .  smelt amazing when we walked in . walked out with the following : - carrot cake - ginger spice cookie - spicy chocolate cookie - gluten free peanut butter cookie  the mini 5 inch cake was a good size not overly priced at $ 7 . was a bit on the sweet side but was n't terrible . just make sure you have it with tea or coffee ( with no sugar ) .  the cookies were $ 1.75 a piece , average for the size of the cookie . however they are the crunchy kind of cookies so if you are looking for a soft chewy cookie , you should skip it .  overall not bad , will be back to try other stuff ! ca n't wait until she adds more gluten free items on the menu !
DOC71 very cozy , in the heart of st. catherine street .  very comfy bed . wireless internet works very well .
DOC72 nice addition to the distillery district ! stumbled upon this place when we were out checking the lights festival . nice place for you to hang out and get a coffee , tea or hot chocolate . they have a few flavours for hot chocolate - best part , you can get it in a dairy free option !  i had tried the peppermint hot chocolate with soy milk and it was nice and minty !  in looking at the menu , you could also grab a bite to eat or walk in their store to look at the different condiments they sell !
DOC73 after reading reviews on this place , thought i would take my family here to give it a try .  but after driving in circles a few times , we realized that this place had closed down - could n't find it at all !
DOC74 cute place in danforth and coxwell area !  it has a nice patio to sit , which is also dog friendly !  we had tried the wild boar pizza - which was very good ! definitely want to try the other items on the menu !  friendly service . definitely will be back here more often since it is so close to us !
DOC75 you can see that people only eat here to use the vouchers they have purchased - as they seem to always have some sort of deal available .  unless you come early enough - make sure you make reservations , otherwise it will take up to 30 mins to get seated ( for a table of 2 ) .  the food is ok. not the greatest i 've had , but definitely not the worst . for the price you are paying ( $ 15 for $ 30 worth of food ) - it 's ok .  definitely only visit if you had purchased a voucher .
DOC76 my sister is a big fan of the noodles here as they do have some soup options with no msg .  the way the system works is that it is a combo :  - soup base option ( no msg fish soup or chicken soup base ) - two toppings are included with additional toppings at $ 1.75 each - types of noodles - 1 hot drink is included but other options have an additional charge  then you also have an option of adding side items .  i had ordered the parsley and century egg fish soup with fish filet , fish tofu , cabbage and flat rice noodles . not sure if it is due to the type of noodles i had picked but i found it a little lacky in flavour .  otherwise , it was n't bad , pretty big portions . i would also upgrade to a cold drink next time since the hot lemon tea that i had gotten was n't really that great .
DOC77 this is a most stop for me and my girlfriend whenever i 'm back in to . we always order :  - the radish cake - calamari  both are really good - but it is a bit spicy .  and typically we will order a congee ( you really ca n't go wrong with any of them ) and a noodle dish .  what can i say ? congee and noodles is always good .
DOC78 saw that this was in my neighbourhood so decided to give it a try !  i had purchased a regular croissant and an almond croissant .  the croissants were very flaky however i ca n't say i was too pleased with the regular croissant as it had a burnt taste to it ( which i really do n't care for ) .  the almond croissant was really good , i would go back for that one . they had a beautiful display of sweets which i would like to go back to try .
DOC79 read an article online about this being the best gluten-free shop in toronto . not sure if i agree . they definitely have some interesting items like vegan , gluten free breads that i have n't really seen anywhere else . the store is much smaller than i thought it would be ( based on what their website says ) . when i read their description of prepared foods and items in-store i was really excited about the variety . but once i found the store ( which is hidden if you do n't pay attention ) , i was disappointed .  a lot of the other items they carry on the shelf can be found in various stores around toronto at a way cheaper price too .  if you are in the neighbourhood , do go in and browse . otherwise not really worth the drive up there .
DOC80 really 3.5 stars ...  was n't bad sushi . decent but definitely a bit on the pricier side . the rolls are slightly smaller . shared two rolls with the hubby and felt like i wanted more and usually we feel full after 2 rolls .  we had tried :  - sushi couture maki ( *signature roll ) : salmon , scallop , tobiko - it typically has spicy mayo , but we asked for no mayo since the other roll had it - princess maki : spicy tuna wrapped with avocado , bbq eel , tuna , and salmon  both rolls were delicious , just wish it was slightly bigger !
DOC81 tried to book an appointment to use the voucher my friend had given me . it was for a mani\/pedi\/foot massage . left a message , but never heard back .  finally decided to email them , requesting for an appointment . the response i got back was they are under new ownership and is no longer accepting the vouchers .  such a disappointment !
DOC82 hand made noodles . fast . great service . open kitchen . need i to say more ?  there was a line up when we got there , but it moves pretty fast ( approximately 10 mins wait ) . as soon as the server sees you there waiting , he offers you a glass of water .  staff is extremely friendly and nice . service is really fast . even faster when you speak chinese to them .  my boyfriend and i had ordered the soup dumplings , sweet and sour veggie pork noodle and a beef noodle . the soup dumplings were good , as they are made on the spot . the veggie pork handmade noodle was really good . the beef noodle , not so much .  they are definitely known more for their handmade noodles .  will be returning the next time i 'm in town to try the spicy noodle and shanghai noodle everyone is raving about !
DOC83 saw that there was a new place in the neighborhood and decided to try it out . they did not disappoint !  had ordered the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich and a classic poutine to go .  the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich was excellent ! it was very light and was not greasy at all ! will definitely be back to try the other items on the menu .  as for the poutine ... it was soggy and nothing special . will be back to try the onion rings .
DOC84 nice and light tasting cakes ! tried an original and matcha green tea slices .  similar to lady m cakes !  will be back to check on the ice cream !
DOC85 suzanne was able to get my business five t.v . segments in the first two weeks of hiring her . very honest , and professional . just a wonderful human being . i really enjoyed working with her . she is a fantastic communicator . she is the best p.r . in the valley !
DOC86 they sell wrecked vehicles ! i purchased a 2010 nissan altima with 41,000 miles on it in 2013 from planet nissan . they charged me $ 18,000 and provided me with no warranty , except for manufacturer powertrain . immediately after purchasing the vehicle i began having to make out of pocket repairs to the suspension , brakes and exhaust system every 6 to 9 months with absolutely no clue as to why after all the repairs the car still drove somewhat unsteady at high speeds . two years after i bought the car i was finally sick of the constant problems and decided to trade it in with another dealership , during the trade in process i found out that planet nissan had sold the vehicle to me knowing that it was involved in a `` major '' car accident which caused frame damage six months prior to them selling it to me . unfortunately there 's not much i can do now , but i would advise any savvy consumer to avoid this dealership by all means possible and go someplace that is a bit more reputable !
DOC87 we got a permit to have wedding photos taken here . the garden itself was great : 5 stars all around .  the staff was horrible . the person manning the place claimed there were no bathrooms , complained about where our group was standing ( twice ! ) , and then warned us that 'if you are n't out on time i will come in and find you , and i really do n't want to do that . ' its been a long time since i was treated so rudely .  go to the garden , avoid the staff .
DOC88 no problems at all with this place . the staff was cheery , helpful and fun . the room ( we got one with a whirlpool ) was clean and comfortable . the building was nice .  no complaints at all .
DOC89 we had gaylord cater our wedding reception . the staff was friendly and helpful , though they were especially good with setup and tear down . the food was above average for a catering . in particular their stuffed portobello mushroom was quite nice . we also got some relatively healthy and tasty potato and vegetable dishes . they were also priced quite reasonably for what we got .  a good experience all around with no major negatives . i would consider gaylord for catering again .
DOC90 we had these guys cater our wedding . we ended up having 6 different flavors of cake . all were delicious , although the carrot cake was especially exceptional . the staff was friendly and prepared .  all around a great experience .
DOC91 visiting from sf . checked yelp and found this place . it is very small -- a converted house . as you sit in it you can watch the kitchen . the food was excellent . we had an eggplant\/red pepper omelet and peach waffles . the waffles were light and fluffy with fresh whipped creme .  we got pastries to go , which were also good , in particular the chocolate croissant was unique .  great place for an informal breakfast .
DOC92 we always go to the chevo 's in chandler which is delicious , the one in ahwatukee is different for some reason . ordered the chicken rolled tacos today there was a tiny lil piece of chicken in each one , so basically i had 3 rolled deep fried tortillas yuck ! : ( no flavor what so ever . also ordered carne asada taco the meat tasted old like it was cooked earlier and just thrown on the grill to get warm . very dissapointed ! !
DOC93 this place is always so dirty and grimy , been there twice and will not be back . customer service is horrible ! ! !
DOC94 horrible customer service ! ! warning do not purchase anything from here , do n't waste your time ! ! ! purchased $ 2,500 worth of furniture told sells person numerous times to deliver furniture in original boxes i did n't want it assembled . well received my delivery and everything was assembled ! ! ! ! ! $ 700 table was damaged ! ! ! ! living room furniture was stuffed in delivery truck with people 's nasty old mattress ... .completely unprofessional and not worth it ! ! ! sent my whole order back for refund ! ! called customer service talked with a guy named chris , the absolute worst customer service agent i 've ever spoken too ... ..was missing the love seat , well guess what it 's completely sold out . please spare your time and money ! do n't waste it here , furniture might be good price but not worth the experience . i must save delivery guys were very nice .
DOC95 i bought a groupon voucher for double wings art . when i tried to use it , they did not recognize it and told me to go back to groupon . this is not a customer friendly place and as of now , i think i may have been scammed .
DOC96 i started going to this nail salon last summer , so for almost a year now . it had just opened when i started going and i walked in off the street because i figured i 'd take a chance , it looked clean and it was close to home . i was greeted by the owner , a pleasant chinese woman , who did my nails that day . since then , i 've been back at least once a month for manicures and pedicures . those are the only things i 've had done , but i would suspect that the other services are pretty good as well . the spa is new and everything is spacious and clean . they have massaging chairs for pedicures and the prices are reasonable . it 's a basic nail place , so the bells and whistles are not numerous , but that suits me fine because it keeps the price down , allows for walk-ins and gets you in and out pretty quickly . some of the ladies in the salon do a better job than others , but no one does a bad job . i have had plenty of bad manicures before , so i know what a bad job looks like . just do n't go expecting someone to fuss over you , or give you plenty of conversation . english is not the first language and i have never felt the need to force conversation . in this past year i have noticed a huge increase in the number of people that go to this spa , so they seem to be doing quite well . i have never had to wait more than ten minutes for service though and i 'm happier they are busy because it means they are doing well and will stay in business . good for them and for me ! some of the services they give include manicures , pedicures , gel nails , waxing , threading , eyebrow tinting and ear candles .
DOC97 i give up on this place ! i have gotten burritos and other things from this place on several occasions and it 's always been sub-par . bland food , overcooked , sometimes burnt ( nachos ) . as a result , i have n't bothered going or ordering from there in well over a year . well , today i had a craving for mexican and since toronto has a huge lack of mexican restaurant choices and because i 'm busy working at home , my husband and myself decided to order from barburrito 's delivery . i should also mention that if you go to justeat.ca barburrito charges $ 7 delivery . orderit.ca has no charge . do n't know if that 's the ordering website or the restaurant , but it 's a tip for anyone who decides to order from this place .  so i went ahead and placed the order ... only to have it be `` rejected '' by barburrito , because they are busy right now . this restaurant is listed on two different food ordering sites , but they wo n't deliver if they do n't feel inclined ? ? seriously !  so i have learned my lesson . do n't give places second , or even third chances . and this place ... do n't even give it a first chance . not worth it at all .
DOC98 i think i may have been let down by this place because of all the rave reviews . but the fact is , i 've eaten here twice and neither time was spectacular .  my expectations of a breakfast place are cheap prices , good food ( because eggs are hard to mess up ) , fast turnover and service . this place has prices on the high end of breakfast place , on weekends they are very crowded and it will take some time to be seated and the food is alright .  the last time i went , i was with my husband and we went in the door to a huge crowd . there was no wait to be seated sign , but we guessed correctly and waited . problem is that you pay and wait in the same place , which meant people were coming and going in a very small area . it was chaos for awhile . finally we were seated outside at a picnic table and told that other people may be seated with us at the table , because they lacked space .  the waitress took some time to arrive and by then we were ready to give our order . i ordered eggs and bacon and toast . we also each ordered fruit smoothies . i asked for mine without banana . the waitress came back a few minutes later and said with a straight face , `` the guys back there put like three bananas in your smoothie ! ''  it took me a minute to realize she was joking ... .heh ... .  we played several rounds of scrabble on an iphone because the food was taking quite awhile and it finally came out . our drinks were no where to be seen . we had to ask twice for them . by then we were almost done the food !  the food was alright , but i usually go to places like egg smart and for the cost , they give you way more food , for a better price and honestly , i think it tastes way better . these famous `` boom frites '' are just thick , cut potatoes and they give you one slice of toast !  anyway , if you 're in the area and really want some breakfast , it 's not terrible , but i think you can do way better !  oh , and i disagree that it 's a good place for a group . unless you want to wait forever ... or make a group by joining another couple at their picnic table !
DOC99 this place is always solid and the customer service always very nice . it 's not the best japanese\/korean food out there , but it 's consistently good . what is lacks in finesse it makes up for in portion size . the portions are huge . it 's our go-to sushi place these days .
DOC100 sometimes it feels so good to be so bad ... for you . i have been dying to try out an actual poutinerie for a long time and it did not disappoint . i 've been twice now . once i had the basic poutine and once i had the pulled pork poutine . both are good , but i really love that pulled pork poutine . the bbq sauce they have has just a touch of sweetness and it really compliments the fries and cheese curds . a large poutine is more than enough for two people and i liked the little restaurant space with the 80s glam rock playing and quirky pictures on the walls . i guess my only criticism is that they need more seating . both times i 've been we got lucky and managed to snag seats as someone was leaving , but it 's gross out on the street and this summer anyway , it 's been so hot outside . they do n't have space for more seats , so this is n't really something they can easily fix , but maybe something to keep in mind for future establishments ? anyway , if you want a very unhealthy treat , it 's a go !
DOC101 i have since switched hairdressers and am going elsewhere . angela continued doing a fine job , but it was always the same . very busy and always a bit sloppy . for example , no one ever put colour protector around my head , so you 'd always end up with dye all over your skin and ears . they would send you home with some dye remover wrapped in tin foil , to wipe it away . this sort of stuff can be overlooked if the job is excellent , but it was always just good . finally , i decided to see if i could n't do better elsewhere . still looking for that perfect hairdresser though .
DOC102 i have eaten at several of these chains , every time thinking that perhaps this chance will be a bit better and honestly , this food is so underwhelming , i just give up at this point . the meat is bland and often dry and overcooked , served with rice and a salad ( generic lettuce with ranch dressing-type stuff ) and their naan tastes like cardboard . the rest of the stuff is edible , but the naan is just plain atrocious . i have had afghani food in other locations and it 's flavourful and delicious . this does not hold up . i guess it 's take out quality , so a sort of mcdonald 's version of afghan food , but i 'd take a big mac any day over this stuff . bleh .
DOC103 this whole place basically sucks and it 's even worse now . i have had so many bad experiences at this place , i just need to give up on it .  a few years ago , sheppard centre was an alright place . when i lived at yonge and sheppard , there was a grocery store across the street and all the basics you would need st sheppard centre and it was good .  sheppard centre is at a major subway stop , in a hugely busy area , but somehow stores keep failing here .  that being the case , there are a few stores that are nice and handy . i would consider this mall for errands , now that i live away ... except that the major reason for coming is gone now .  sheppard centre used to have 1 hour of free parking , which is a huge draw . you could go and park , run in and pick up your mail , or something from shoppers drug mart and be on your way . they got rid of that . not only that , but it 's $ 3.50 for half an hour or under !  i think this is pretty pathetic for a crappy mall .  `` oh , but they have to pay for their excellent staff ! '' you say ?  yeah , let me tell you about the staff that work there . first of all , you should also know that the ticket machine to pay for your parking tickets likes to break down all the time , so you have to go to the parking garage and drive up to the ticket booth , park in the non-parking spots , block traffic and go in and pay the guys sitting around in the office ... an office with tv screens of the parking garage , where our car has been broken into before ... but it 's not their fault . there are signs that say they are not liable . soooo ... what are the tv screens for ? to watch peoples ' cars get broken into and laugh ?  right , so back to the story !  before i knew what to do when the machines broke down , i went to the in-mall security\/info booth to ask . the guy was behind the booth , on the phone , having a personal conversation . he saw me , but turned away and continued for ten minutes . finally he got off the phone and made like he was coming over ... only to turn away at the last second and start going through some papers . finally i called out and said , `` excuse me ? '' he told me he was busy and made a point of moving towards me as slowly as possible .  this is n't the only time a staff member has been rude to me before . dogs are allowed in the subway , so i was walking through once , to the subway entrance , holding my dog , in my arms and a security guard chased me down to tell me dogs are not allowed . i told him i was just heading to the subway , so he followed me there to make sure . yeah , because i really wanted to take my dog to the dollarstore and was clearly lying . go stop people from breaking into cars !  bayview village , down the street , or one subway stop over , has a shoppers , a grocery store , a post office , a blacks photography and clothing stores ... like sheppard centre . it also has a chapters with a starbucks , an lcbo , good restaurants and the people there are polite , the bathrooms nicer than mine at home and parking is free .  so basically sheppard centre can bite me . i 'm done with them .
DOC104 okay , so from what i am reading , a lot of other people got sort of `` conned '' into this hotel and i am no exception . we booked a trip through gate1travel.com and when you are booking they give you the options for hotels . the default booking is for circus circus , not circus , circus manor motor lodge . it says three stars and even says this on gate1 's travel site : `` the rooms are fitted with contemporary decor and furnishings . all rooms are equipped with amenities that will be sure to make your stay pleasant , such as internet access ( surcharge ) , a hair dryer , and a television with cable channels . '' we looked up circus circus , saw it was nothing special , but alright and went for it ... and found out that in fact , we were in the manor motor lodge . now , i know that this is gate1 's fault and i 'll be taking it up with them as well . also , i want to point out that on my second night , i complained and they put us in a suite for the night , so this is nothing against the overall hotel , but there are still a few things people need to know staying here . rooms : they are dumps in the manor motor lodge . i asked , when we were checking in , if those rooms had been redone at all and was told that `` all the rooms have been updated in some way '' ... well i do n't know what way this room had been updated . the carpets were worn and stained . the bedding was the polyester crap from the 80s . the wallpaper was stained and peeling off the walls . the bathroom floor had cracks in the tile and a permanent grunge that could never been cleaned . it looked like a motel room you see in horror movies ! the hallways were constantly loud and smelled of marijuana , with cheap , apple air freshener over top , which was interesting because of the number of small children running around with distinctly trashy families . i even made a joke with a cab driver in las vegas , that we were not ugly enough to be staying in this hotel . he agreed and said it was the butt of the joke of cabbies on the strip . good to know .  hotel : the hotel amenities are geared towards children , but are basically a money grab . there is a small , indoor amusement park that costs something like $ 8\/30 second ride . there are shops and restaurants , but non are high end . we ate at three places while there and overall they were crappy . i 'll give those individual ratings though .  service : this was very good actually . i had a very pleasant bell hop help us out and all the wait staff and cleaning staff were very nice and the woman whom i complained to was very receptive and polite , so that earns them an extra star .  the thing with the hotel is that even these rooms we were stuck in , fall under 3 stars , even though they , by themselves , would barely qualify as 1 star rooms , because the whole hotel falls under one heading .  so , lesson to be learned , these rooms are not nice rooms . the hotel is considerably crappier than other hotels . it 's also quite far from the main strip . but it is cheap . if you are ( for whatever god-awful reason ) bringing children to vegas , i guess this would fit the bill . otherwise , if you 're just looking for a bed and a cheap one , this also fits the bill . the beds , i will say , had clean sheets and were comfortable . but do n't be fooled into thinking you 're getting this amazing deal on a three star hotel . you 're not . you 're getting an average deal , on 1 star accommodations .
DOC105 ok is sort of the perfect description of this place . it 's fine ... it 's not great !  we went here on a saturday night . it 's literally a block away from where we live and we have somehow never been . we finally decided to go for it !  the atmosphere is fine . it 's nice and clean and much larger than you would realize from the outside . the decor it a bit cheesy with faux roman sculptures .  service was very good . the waiter was quick with our drinks and food and was helpful with suggestions .  now to the food . my husband ordered the veal parm and i ordered a pasta with chicken . we ordered brushetta as a starter . i noticed from the menu that , while a lot of selection , many of the pasta dishes were a bit uninspired . a lot of very basic dishes . pasta with mushrooms and red sauce , or pasta with shrimp and pesto , etc . i really enjoy creative combinations and flavours when i go to an italian restaurant , because quite honestly , i can make the basic stuff at home ... for a hell of a lot cheaper .  that said , the pasta dishes were solid , if nothing special . my pasta was well cooked , but the chicken tasted like something you would find in a mcdonald 's salad and the mushrooms were good , but that was the basis of the dish . my husband 's was basic , but veal parms usually are . he did note that there was a lot of sauce on his . there was , but i like that personally , if there is bread to dip into it ... but no bread was served to our table , other than the bread from our brushetta .  the brushetta was n't great . the tomato mixture on top was good , but the bread was n't properly toasted , so it got soggy and could n't hold its shape . it kept falling apart when you picked it up .  the desserts really brought this place back for me . i had their homemade creme brule and it was really excellent . on the menu it tells you which are made in-house and i would highly recommend getting one of those .  overall , it was quite expensive for pretty basic italian food , so it did n't stun me . i 'm not opposed to going back , but it 's not my first choice . my major reason for going back will be for convenience , because it is so close to us .
DOC106 we wanted something sweet for dessert , so after dinner we made our way to this place , which boasts the best gelato in toronto .  the gelato was good , but certainly was n't the best i 've had . it was much more akin to ice cream and the flavour selection was n't huge .  that said , they have some interesting flavours . i personally tried twix and birthday cake and they were both very good . the more traditional flavour i tried ( creme caramel ) was a little boring and lacked flavour .  my husband had the strawberry , skor and chocolate . all fine , none blew me away .  okay , so the gelato is good , if not the `` best '' ! but perhaps that 's being picky . if i 'm in the area and want some dessert , this place is great and i can imagine in the summer it 's fantastic .  so why the three stars ? ? first of all you can only get gelato in two sizes - regular and large . there is no small option and both of those options are quite large . if you only want a taste of gelato , there is no option for you !  secondly , although this place is named for it 's gelato , it also specializes in cupcakes . we got a cupcake to bring home . when asked if we would like it packaged to bring home we said yes ... and they threw it in a bag . the girl apologized and said they had nothing appropriate to package it in . why did you offer then ? ? but furthermore , yes you do ! you literally have perfectly shaped round cups to put gelato in everywhere ! guess what shape cupcakes are ? ?  oh well , no biggie .  so , since this place is about the gelato and the cupcakes , you may be interested in the cupcakes ... well the taste was overall good , but it was a very oily cupcake . the icing especially . the cake was moist , which is good ... except it was so moist the cake was just falling apart everywhere !  so what 's the final synopsis . this place is n't bad . it has some delicious options . but nothing is perfect and in fact there are a number of flaws , which prevent me from giving it a better score . we 'll see how i feel if it 's a boiling hot summer day and i go in there for gelato though ... i may be singing a different tune !
DOC107 pandora charms are great , but not at this location .  i purchased a charm from pandora and it was put directly onto the bracelet . overnight , i reconsidered one of the charms and wanted to exchange it . i brought it back , with the receipt , but was informed that i could n't exchange it , because it was on the bracelet . i explained that it had been put there by an employee . the manager was brought out and she was immediately snarky and rude towards me . she said she would n't accept a charm that was `` all worn and beat up '' . i encouraged her to look at the charm . she could clearly see it was in pristine condition . she glanced at my bracelet as a whole , but did not look at the charm , instead insisting that she could tell .  seriously lady , you do n't stand by your product at all ? your jewellery is so crappy it just gets beaten up and looks like crap after being worn for probably an hour total ? ! ? this was n't even my fault ! ! ! plus , she could clearly see from my bracelet that i had spent a lot of money on my bracelet and am a loyal customer .  i know that if i had gotten a pandora box and put the charm in it and brought it back , they would have exchanged it without a problem . i ca n't now , because i 'm sure i would be recognized . instead i 'll go to another location ... where perhaps i 'll be treated like a valued customer and not a leper .  i 've had bad experiences at this location before . the employees here seem to think customers are beneath them . each location is independently owned , so needless to say i wo n't purchase from this location again . anyone who wants to purchase from pandora i encourage you to check out the scarborough or fairview mall locations . always had good experiences at those locations .  instead i have sent a complaining email to pandora head office . we 'll see what they respond with .
DOC108 while i really enjoyed the noodles , their signature pork buns , which seemed to be something everyone orders and raves about , i did not like at all . the pork was pure fat and while it was n't gristly , it was so greasy , the grease positively dripped all over your hands . it was hugely unappetizing . i could n't taste the cucumbers and did n't see any evidence of scallions . it was basically just pure fat , wrapped in a bland `` bun '' . so i guess if you enjoy really fatty , greasy appetizers , this is the right deal . ( really , i ca n't stress enough how fatty the pork was ... it was purely , white , greasy fat ! either change the name of the dish to pork fat buns , or please add some actual pork ! )  the noodles however , were quite good and i liked the flavour combinations . i had the dan dan noodles , which is spicy pork , dried scallops and peanuts . i enjoyed that you could really taste the peanuts . i was a little disappointed that the pork was ground pork , instead of shredded pork . it made the dish seem cheaper and less inspired .  i liked the atmosphere , but the seating is at long tables and so you share the space with whoever they place next to you . the seats are long benches , so if you 're in the middle of the bench , you have to lift your leg over ... i saw guys struggling to do this ... now imagine being a girl , wearing a skirt and having to do this . no graceful way to go about that !  to be honest , this place just did n't blow me away enough to make a conscious effort to return . it certainly was n't terrible , but it was n't really good either .
DOC109 we booked a reservation at smith for summerlicious . one of the major problems was finding it though . almost every one in our party either did n't see it initially ( it 's sort of nondescript looking ) , or were n't sure which door\/staircase was the proper one to get inside . once inside though , it 's an eclectic blend of vintage meets white-washed industrial . if you did n't know that was a style , neither did i , but it totally works . there was a great blend of music in the background ... it was a mix , probably an employee just made it , but it was great mood music . i want that mix cd ! my brother had called several weeks ago to make a reservation and somehow they did n't have it . apparently it 's an answering service for reservations and they say they call you back if they ca n't accommodate you . he never received a call back , so the assumption was that the reservation was alright . unfortunately , as i said , there was no reservation . the staff apologized profusely though and luckily there was space and they set up a table for us right away . we ordered from the drink menu and i will say that they drinks are very expensive . the wine is what you would expect and the mixed drink ( at least the one i had , the smith lemonade ) was fantastic , but it was also $ 12 , which is steep even for toronto bar standards . as i said , we ordered from the summerlicious menu . i have heard many comments online that people are feeling disillusioned with summerlicious because so many restaurants give you the cheapest options and it 's not worth the cost . this was not the case with smith at all . there were several great options to choose from and the food was excellent . i had the curried carrot soup , which was spicy but great . every one else in my party also enjoyed their various appetizers . my main course was a georgian bay whitefish , which was done perfectly , just crispy enough on the outside and flaky on the inside . the pork chops were also raved about . there was also a risotto , which two of the three people who ordered it really enjoyed . you ca n't take that last guy ( brother again ) too seriously , since he 's a very picky eater . the desserts were all good , however the fudge ice cream , is really just chocolate ice cream , nothing special . the lemon curd tasted like lemon pie filling and was delicious and the bread pudding was heavenly ! seriously , it was so good . i think everyone left feeling really satisfied . it did take a long time to get the food . this was n't a problem for us , since we were there to converse and i understand that great food may take some time , but if you are really hungry , or looking for a quicker meal , this is n't the right choice . basically it lost of star because of the lost reservation and lack of visibility from the street . also , we were n't thrilled with the washrooms . besides the fact that they are co-ed , which is a little weird , there is one , large sink and a foot peddle to operate it . since only one person can step on it at a time , you have to wait for that person to finish , before you can wash your hands , which starts to cause a bit of a back-up if more than two people are in the washroom . also , the hand dryers were weak\/not working . that said , i would n't let a slightly annoying bathroom stop me from coming here ! this is a nice , little place !
DOC110 a couple of weeks ago i was watching diner 's , drive-ins and dives ... big mistake ! this show is a heart attack in the making .  it also gives you cravings ... often for food you ca n't possibly get , because they 're making some crazy thing across the country that you can not possibly find a duplicate for .  naturally i got a crazy craving for fish and chips ... my mistake being that this was a sunday and for whatever reason , no fish and chip places are open on sunday .  i did a lot of looking around , before i found this place , which was n't too far away and was , most importantly , open !  this is a quirky place , with wood panelling on the walls and some random fish hung around the place .  fry 's boasts full day breakfasts and the fish and chips . i saw plenty of people coming for the full day breakfasts , which are decently priced and looked pretty good , if nothing special .  we came for the f & cs though !  we ordered the single piece , which was more than enough food . quite expensive though . you 're looking at around $ 15\/meal of one large piece of fish and some fries .  it was good , but it was n't great . worst of all , the tartar sauce came in sealed packages ... .ugh .  i 'm sorry , but when i 'm paying a premium for my fish and chips , at a place named after it 's fish and chips ... i want some damn proper tartar sauce ! it 's only like the easiest thing in the world to make .  service was fine . no complaints . the waitress did her job ... took our order , gave us our food and gave us the bill ... .that was her job and she did no more and no less .  the restaurant ambiance was n't there , the food was n't special and the prices were n't good .  next time i get a fish and chips craving i 'm going to try elsewhere .
DOC111 okay , so my rating has gone down from the first time i went here .  i came again , with my family , for my birthday , at the beginning of october . even though we had a reservation , our table was n't ready . we were finally seated and the waiter introduced himself ... and then disappeared . came back ten minutes later and took drink orders and then disappeared for 15 minutes ... this continued the entire time . our dinner took a long time . it took forever for our drinks to be served and even longer for our food to come out . then when the food came out , we got two plates and then waited five minutes for one more plate ... then waited another five minutes for another plate . it took our group 15 minutes just for us all to receive the food ! obviously we could n't eat until everyone had been served and the food was getting cold at that point .  oh , the best part ? ? someone mentioned it was my birthday and the waiter said , `` oh , so you 're a january baby , '' indicating to when i was conceived ... to my parents . yes ... thank you sir . i would really like to be reminded of my parents ' doing it , right before dinner ... because that 's completely appropriate .  so yes , the service this time was terrible !  but , everyone enjoyed their food and thought it was really good , so there ya have it . service hit or miss , but food is good .
DOC112 we ended up here because moroco had rented out their entire restaurant for a party and we wanted a decadent dessert . we went in and looked at the selection and decided what we wanted and when the person behind the counter asked to take our order and we said we wanted to sit down . he would n't take the order and instead had us sit down and look at menus . we explained we knew what we wanted already , but he said he 'd be back in a minute . this was fine , we were n't in a rush , but we were both a little confused by the ten minutes we sat there waiting for him . when he finally came out , as we were ordering , his cell phone rang and he took the call and walked away , around the corner of the building . we waited for about five minutes for him to finish his call and he finally took our order . umm ... that was some pretty shocking un-professionalism , but we laughed it off and ordered .  i ordered basic new york cheesecake and my friend ordered an apple cheesecake . cheesecakes were good , ( she really liked her ) and we ordered cappuccino and a flavored san pellegrino and they were good and big sizes , but my cheesecake was a bit frozen in the middle . knowing it was n't fresh sort of took away from the experience . anyway , we had a fine time here and the desserts are good , but not great . it was the service that was most disappointing .  will i go back ? ? yes , if moroco is closed again !
DOC113 seems silly to write a review about an established makeup chain , but i have always had good experiences at this particular location . first of all , i find that this location seems to be sold out of things less often than others . this is an overall problem with the sephoras in this city - they sell out of things and do n't restock often enough . one of sephora 's policies is that if you are , at any time , unhappy or unsatisfied with a product , you can return or exchange it . i bought a cream eyeliner from this sephora several months ago and used about half of it before it decided to dry out ( even though i had been keeping the lid on it ) . i took it back actually because i was hoping there might be some cream or something i could add , that would make it creamy again . no need ! they offered to give me a new one , or exchange mine . i chose exchange and they gave me a new brand that they said was excellent and said they would mention the problem to the sales rep that was coming in for that brand next week . not that i expect big things to come from that per say , but i 'm happy they did n't just blow it off ! my only problem with sephora ( all of them ) is that you need to make an appointment in advance to get makeup put on and you are required to spend a certain amount of money , while every other makeup seller does this service for free and accommodates walk-ins . i just hear people asking about it a lot and i had a party to go to one night and was downtown and wanted someone to help me touch up my makeup ( without doing it myself using samples in the store ) and they were very reluctant to help . you 'll sell more things people ! ! !
DOC114 poor hero burger is getting a lot of flack from people . i 've never had anything but good experiences here . i think the burgers here are heads and tails above many other gourmet burger places , mainly because the diversity of toppings .  i like the fries here , but they 're nothing special . same with the poutine , same with the onion rings ( i ; ve tried em all ) . but those burgers are good ! no word of a lie !  i think the prices are pretty standard for these types of burger places and service has always been fine for me .  they have a great coke machine ... which i know sounds super weird , but you choose your drink ... and then can choose the flavour . for example ... if i want fanta , i select that and can then choose any number of fanta flavours . i always go with a diet cherry coke ... where else does that even exist in canada ? ? ? ! ( i 'll tell you actually . you can get that at licks , but they get really confused when you ask for diet coke , instead of regular ... they make it themselves ) .  criticisms of the small location are valid . this place is very small and cramped . not nice to eat in ... or even to wait . but it is what it is . they have a mounted flat screen for people to watch and they 've done what can can in a super small space .
DOC115 basically i have been here two times , both for waxing , so that is all i am commenting on . both times i have gone because my normal waxer has been mia and this place is conveniently close . that said , i find it very expensive , especially for what you get . the first time i went i got the works done ... legs , bikini , underarms , etc . the person doing the waxing was very pleasant and kept the conversation going , which i appreciated , but i was still red for days , something i have rarely experienced before in years of waxing . that said , she got the job done . today , however , i had a different girl , who was also very pleasant , but it was n't until i got home , that i realized what a shoddy job she had done . patches of hair are still there . i pretty much have to get this redone and i had to pay more to go to this place than any other place i 've been to + tip ! not only that , but the facility for waxing is pretty pitiful . it 's a very small room , with the `` bed '' pushed up against a wall . when i went in the summer it was very warm , so i 'm not sure if there are a\/c or not . the other wall is entirely windows , which of course always have the blinds closed . it 's a weirdly appointed room for a waxing area . perhaps it was originally a storage closet ? with windows ? ? i do n't know , but it 's not as though you 're going here and paying more because the atmosphere is so much nicer ! anyway , as i said , this place is used in a pinch and now , i 'm not sure i 'd bother using it for that either !
DOC116 no ... i 've had it with this place . i refuse to go back . management changed sometime last year and this place took a huge dive ... worse than before . there is one waitress who works the entire restaurant . the service is hugely lacking as a result .  last time i went , they had half price appetizers . we were told that they could n't separate the bill and she brought us one large bill ... .oh , but she could n't subtract the half price from our apps , because she needed the manager , who was n't there to do it . so she found different items , that were the same cost as the half price items we got and made the bill with them ... .well how in hell are we supposed to divide up our bill , based on items we did n't order ? ? ? ? ! ? it was actually shockingly stupid .  we all guessed as best we could and threw in cash ... i for one threw in the towel too . the food continues to be subpar at best , the prices are not great , even with half price and the service is horrendously terrible . this place is a waste of time and money .
DOC117 i went here with my husband and another couple as the start to our double date night . i reserved a table on the wednesday before and i 'm glad i did , but even still we were originally seats in a less than ideal table . i spoke to the hostess and a manager came out and graciously moved us , which was very nice of them , because apparently many people call and reserve specific seats !  i have walked by this restaurant a million times and never known it was there . it is directly on bloor , but in a small `` mall '' which houses the japanese foundation and some other businesses . the restaurant is on the second floor and there are no readily visible signs on the street , so you would never think to just walk into this place ... maybe that 's the point !  the decor of the restaurant is really lovely . they have a huge , stain glass ceiling and dark wooden furniture and art nouveau decor . the bathrooms are large , individually sectioned off stall , with white and black tiles everywhere and large , vintage , french ads on the walls .  two of our party ordered from the winterlicious menu , one ordered from the regular menu and i ordered from their regular prix fixe menu , which they have available all the time and is $ 7 more than the winterlicious .  they were also offering some winterlicious cocktails ... i had three ( the same one ) and they were excellent .  our appetizers included two salads , which looked great and ( according to the orderes ) were . my husband ordered the onion soup from the winterlicious menu and it was great and i ordered the mushroom soup from the prix fixe and it was excellent !  the main courses included steak from the regular menu , which were ordered with steak frites . the steak was a nice cut of meat , prepared exactly as asked and the steak frites were served with a garlic aioli ( which we all tried ) and was really good !  the lasagna and pork belly were ordered from the winterlicious menu . lasagna came in a rounded dish , where it had been baked and was on the smaller side , but satisfying within a three course meal . my husband had the pork belly from the winterlicious menu and i tried that . the sauce on it and the tenderness of the pork were really nice .  i had the pistachio chicken , which was a huge dish ! the chicken breast was served on top of another cut of chicken , but in dark meat . both had pistachios on top and delicious sauces drizzled along the bottom of the plate and a few apple slices as garnish . i could n't finish two pieces of chicken and i stuck mostly with the white meat , but it was a nice option to have to two and i tried the dark and it was really excellent as well !  the reason i chose the prix fixe menu over the winterlicious , was because of the dessert . the winterlicious had the pistachio chicken as a main and the onion soup was an option for the appetizer , but the desserts set the prix fixe apart . on the winterlicious menu the option was a rhubarb crumble , or chocolate mousse . neither of which i really cared for , although i tried it from my husband and it was good . on the prix fixe menu you have a choice of creme brule ( which i have heard good things about ) and a sticky toffee cake . i asked the waitress what she recommended and she said the sticky toffee , because it was such a lovely , winter dessert . i had been set on the creme brule , but you know what ... .brules are a dime a dozen . how many places have sticky , toffee cake ?  i was not disappointed . the cake was amazing ! it was a small , singular bundt cake , topped with a toffee crisp and a small scoop of caramel ice cream and surrounded on the plate with warm , caramel . it was decadent and delicious .  finally i 'll mention that our server was lovely and attentive and not a single person in our party were disappointed in any way . we all left very happy and satisfied .  this place is a little on the pricier end ( would have been less so except for the three drinks myself and my friend had and the beers that the guys had ) , but it 's great for a nice night out , or a romantic date .  i will definitely come back some time in the future .
DOC118 we went here after dinner , simply for drinks . i wanted a cocktail and my sister recommended this place .  good choice mon soeur !  this cute little bar has nice , clean decor , with some interesting touches , such as a large , metal cross on one wall , that i was a big fan of .  the service was great and the drinks were a good size and were excellent . my husband had scotch and said it was very smooth ( that 's more a comment on what they offer , as opposed to bar tending ) , but my sister and my cocktails were great . they are about average price for cocktails , but the size makes it feel more worth it ( $ 10 for our 3 oz drinks ) , in large martini glasses .  we did n't have food here , but i would be interested in coming back some time and giving it a try !
DOC119 this small gallery is a bit hard to get to at present , because of construction going on right outside of it on the street , but the walkway through is filled with people working in textiles , sculpture and glass blowing , so it 's pretty cool . i took a school group there . fyi for only $ 1\/person you can book a tour and the gallery theatres will be yours exclusively . we were not so on top of things and just showed up with 35 kids . luckily , they were really accommodating and we split the kids into two groups to watch the clock . worked out really well and the kids really liked it . i was so appreciative of how nice the gallery staff were . it 's a small gallery , but with interesting exhibits .
DOC120 i was so surprised to see the negative reviews of this place , after having just had such a good experience there ! i went with a bunch of friends from work . some of the friends has heard that this place knows their wine and ordered a bottle of chianti , which was great ( and i 'm not a huge wine drinker ) . the ladies i was with ordered two caesar salads to share amongst the four of them and the waitress brought them out the salads already split on individual plates , garnished with a garlic bread crouton . i do n't think the salads were anything special , but i find that caesar salads in general are n't , so peoples ' complaints about them below seem largely unfounded . i ordered the baked goat cheese appetizer ... omg it was so good . goat cheese and grilled veggies on top of a portobello mushroom cap , with some sort of sauce and with salad and shredded carrots and balsamic reduction ... .to die for . for my main i ordered the penne gorgonzola , which was also fabulous ! the members of my partied ordered the veal parmesan ( but grilled veggies instead of the pasta ) , the salmon with a lobster brandy cream sauce , a ny striploin and fettucine and everyone loved their food . one woman i was with is a chef , so i feel like that was saying something . now , since i did n't taste their dishes , i can only expand on my own . the sauce was to die for . creamy , complex and delicious . the pairing of veggies with prosciutto and cheese was excellent . i would order that dish again in a heartbeat ! since we were having a good time and the food had met our expectations , we went for it and ordered dessert ( even though we were all stuffed ) . we all ordered the white chocolate creme br√ªl√©e , except one friend who ordered the tiramisu and were once again not disappointed . our creme br√ªl√©es were crackly on the outside and creamy on the inside . perfect ! the tiramisu was apparently great , served very untraditionally in a large plate , with an indentation like a bowl in the middle . i was also pleased to find out that they serve caffeine-free cappuccinos , so we all ordered those as well and it was served with a little almond biscotti and was great !  altogether my meal came to $ 50 ( tip included ) , which i think is more than i would spend on a normal dinner out , but not crazy . also note though that i did not pay for the wine and did not order any other drinks . that would obviously have increased the price .  the restaurant atmosphere is nothing special , but i 'm disenchanted with the trendy spaces and pretentiously presented food that is n't half as good , so this was n't a concern for me . the restaurant was clean and comfy , but the furniture was a little on the older side ( like the dining chairs you would see in your fussy grandmother 's home ) and fake paintings on the walls .  the service was excellent . our waitress saw to our every need , answered all our questions and came over to chat and make sure we were happy and comfortable regularly .  so , was it perfect ? well as i said , the salad was probably just average and the atmosphere also just average , but those did not pose major problems . i would ultimately give this place 4-1\/2 , but since i ca n't and this leaned more to the good than anything remotely bad , it gets a 5 ! i would go back in a heartbeat !
DOC121 after being scared away from rock & rita 's , we ended up at this place , which was , if nothing else , quieter .  i 'll start by saying that the hostess and our server were both lovely and they 're really what earned the single star , because they were sweet , but the food was just horrible .  i ordered a simple grilled cheese sandwich . i asked the server if it was processed cheese , or `` real '' cheese in the sandwich and he had no idea what i was talking about . i tried to clarify by saying , `` is it like kraft single slices , or deli cheese ? '' he said it was `` good '' . this really should have been a sign and i could probably fault the waiter for this , since you should know what you 're serving , but he was so sweet , i could n't be mad !  my husband ordered a hot dog of sorts .  i asked if there was a way to substitute fries for a salad . there was not , but the server hooked me up and brought me a salad anyway ( no charge ) . i asked for sweet potato fries with the sandwich .  of course , my sandwich was made with plasticy , processed cheese , that was melted to the point of cheeze-wiz and was inedible . i took one bite of the sandwich and could n't do another . i got regular fries , instead of sweet potato ( did n't bother complaining , because i got the free salad , so whatever ... like i said , nice server ! ) my husband 's food was fine , although nothing special . they were good with the refills of our drinks .  anyway , as nice as the servers were , it was n't good . i would avoid eating here if i could .
DOC122 we got recommendations for this place from my parents and so , for our anniversary , we booked here . we were told though that it was first come , first served , in terms of having the ideal seats by the windows that overlook the fountains of the bellagio and the strip . we went for lunch though , so it was n't too busy . we were seated by the window and were promptly served some sort of puffed rolls , with cheese and herbs infused . they were delicious !  we ordered the onion soup to start and i ordered parmesan chicken and my husband ordered a lamb burger . our food came and was delicious . the soup was probably my favorite part . we were feeling very full by the end and so declined dessert , but were still given some jellies and chocolate truffle and then were served a small chocolate mousse , on a decorated plate that said happy anniversary , which was a total surprise ( they had asked when i booked if it was a special occasion , but had said nothing while we were there ) . overall the service was great , the food delicious and the view wonderful . it was a great experience !
DOC123 i went here for the first time yesterday night to celebrate something with my family . several members of my family have been to this place before for summerlicious and really enjoyed it .  a nice atmosphere and excellent service , everyone ordered a variety of different dishes , many of which i tasted . i myself had a chicken salad and thought it was very good . my sister 's pasta dish was amazing though ! our waiter never rushed us out and was quick to refill water and bread and clear dishes , etc . that with an arm brace on !  prices are a little high , which is why i did n't give this place five stars ... i know those amazing places exist out there with great food and great prices , but this was a nice evening out .
DOC124 worst experience ever ! i had been there before to get my nails done and the first time was quite good , but the second time was a hot mess . it looked like a five year old did my nails for me . i went home and took the polish off . but this is the kicker : i could n't get an appointment for highlights at my regular salon and this was close by , so i decided to give it a try ( obviously the nail girl would n't be doing my hair ) . i went in and sat down the a woman with an eastern european accent came to talk with me . i showed her a picture of what i wanted and she showed me various hair dye samples ... .none of which looked like my picture , but i always assume the hair dressers know what 's best . now , you 're all thinking , `` ..and she did a poor job and you hated the colour ... '' right ? nope , she told me she could n't do my hair because i had lice ! of course i freaked out . another hair dresser came over to see if i was alright and i was mortified . she asked if i had experienced any itching . i said no . this hairdresser turned back to the original hairdresser and asked if maybe it was n't too bad yet , but original hairdresser said it was really , really bad . i freaked out and left ( obviously without having anything done ) and went to a shoppers and bought lice shampoo . i went home and had my husband look at my hair . he looked and looked and could find nothing . i still did n't want to take chances , so we tore the house apart and washed and bagged everything and i went to a walk-in clinic . the doctor looked at my head and also said there was nothing there ! since i was paranoid , i still used the shampoo and anytime my head itched in the slightest i went to examine it . but even with my husband and mother looking at my head , we never found a single thing . we did n't even see dandruff ! ! i went to a hairdresser a week later and they told me my hair was beautiful ... but dry at the ends ... yeah , because of the chemical-filled lice shampoo ! thanks a lot you crazy woman ! so ultimately , i never had lice . i do n't know if this woman just decided she did n't feel like doing my hair , or if she was delusional , but i sure wo n't be going back there ever again . no one else should either , unless you want to risk being embarrassed and inconvenienced .
