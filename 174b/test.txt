DOC0 super simple place but amazing nonetheless . it 's been around since the 30 's and they still serve the same thing they started with : a bologna and salami sandwich with mustard .  staff was very helpful and friendly .
DOC1 small unassuming place that changes their menu every so often . cool decor and vibe inside their 30 seat restaurant . call for a reservation .  we had their beef tartar and pork belly to start and a salmon dish and lamb meal for mains . everything was incredible ! i could go on at length about how all the listed ingredients really make their dishes amazing but honestly you just need to go .  a bit outside of downtown montreal but take the metro out and it 's less than a 10 minute walk from the station .
