DOC0 super simple place but amazing nonetheless . it 's been around since the 30 's and they still serve the same thing they started with : a bologna and salami sandwich with mustard .  staff was very helpful and friendly .
DOC1 small unassuming place that changes their menu every so often . cool decor and vibe inside their 30 seat restaurant . call for a reservation .  we had their beef tartar and pork belly to start and a salmon dish and lamb meal for mains . everything was incredible ! i could go on at length about how all the listed ingredients really make their dishes amazing but honestly you just need to go .  a bit outside of downtown montreal but take the metro out and it 's less than a 10 minute walk from the station .
DOC2 lester 's is located in a beautiful neighborhood and has been there since 1951 . they are known for smoked meat which most deli 's have but their brisket sandwich is what i come to montreal for . they 've got about 12 seats outside to go along with the inside .  the smoked meat is up there in quality and taste with schwartz 's and you 'll find less tourists at lester 's as well .
DOC3 love coming here . yes the place always needs the floor swept but when you give out peanuts in the shell how wo n't it always be a bit dirty .  the food speaks for itself , so good . burgers are made to order and the meat is put on the grill when you order your sandwich . getting the small burger just means 1 patty , the regular is a 2 patty burger which is twice the deliciousness .  getting the cajun fries adds a bit of spice to them and whatever size you order they always throw more fries ( a lot more fries ) into the bag .
DOC4 had their chocolate almond croissant and it was amazing ! so light and buttery and oh my how chocolaty .  if you 're looking for a light breakfast then head out here . perfect spot for a coffee\/latt√© before heading out to the old port
DOC5 cycle pub las vegas was a blast ! got a groupon and rented the bike for 11 of us for an afternoon tour . each bar was more fun than the last . downtown las vegas has changed so much and for the better . we had a wide age range in this group from early 20 's to mid 50 's and everyone had so much fun ! our driver tony was knowledgable , friendly and just plain fun ! would recommend this to anyone looking to do something different away from the strip . you wo n't be disappointed !
DOC6 who would have guess that you would be able to get fairly decent vietnamese restaurant in east york ?  not quite the same as chinatown in terms of pricing ( slightly higher ) but definitely one of the better vietnamese restaurants outside of the neighbourhood . when i do n't have time to go to chinatown , this is the next best thing as it is down the street from me .  so far the only items i have tried are the phos ( beef , chicken & vegetarian ) - and they have not disappointed me ! especially the chicken pho .  next time i go back , i 'm going to try the banh cuon ( steamed rice noodle ) and the vermicelli !
DOC7 always drove past this coffee house and wondered about it . bf and i finally made the stop to try this place out .  cute , quaint coffee shop with nice muskoka chairs outside .  bf ordered an ice coffee and really enjoyed it ! guess we will be back again !
DOC8 not bad ! ! love that there is a gluten-free , vegan version of the cheese curds and gravy ! !  have n't done the poutine taste test yet with smoke 's but im excited to see which is better . however poutini 's might win as they are vegan and gluten-free
DOC9 love this place !  peggy is great with dogs and does a great job ! she is very patience with him and will make any adjustments you need before you leave the store . my little guy has no problems coming here .  they also have very good bully sticks ( the non-smelly ones ) that my little guy and his friends love !
DOC10 this is currently my parents new favourite restaurant .  we come here in the morning for dim sum . they are not the cart pushing type of dim sum , it is order off of the sheet . dim sum is not bad and not expensive either .  we also frequent the dinner scene . their set dinner menu is not bad . we typically order a 6 dish menu and it 's big enough to feed a family of 9 with leftovers .  overall , food is pretty tasty !
DOC11 server was a little rude .  ordered the calamari , duck confit poutine and the trout fish with miso soba - all very tasty . definitely not your typical diner .
DOC12 i thought tidy 's flowers had a great reputation as a florist , but i guess i was wrong !  for valentine 's day my boyfriend had ordered roses with tidy 's . however , the flowers that were delivered was not what he had ordered . he had placed in an order for long stem roses , mixed with orchids and was charged for that . what had showed up was a small vase with 4 short cut roses and some greens - table ornament , not really valentine 's day flowers .  in speaking with another friend , something similar happened to her - her fiancee had ordered a dozen of roses for her for valentine 's day while he was in germany as a surprise and they never showed up . so when he called them to complaint , they actually then called up my friend to confirm whether or not she had received the flowers . which she did n't , so they said they would resend - only to have them deliver it to the wrong place .  understanding that valentine 's day is the most busiest day for florists and mistakes do happen , the way they had handled it was not what would have been expected from a florist of that nature .
DOC13 wanted to check out this place due to all the hype i had heard . my friend wanted to come here for her birthday . we had a group of seven and based on the way the seating works ( as it is communal ) , we wind up sharing with another group of five .  food was ok - not sure what the hype was . almost 75 % of the dishes had some sort of cheese in it .  this place is very loud so not ideal for catching up\/talking . not a great place to go if you have any gluten or vegan restrictions .  interesting concept . would definitely recommend to try this place once - but definitely not worth the 30- 45 mins wait .
DOC14 this place is awesome ! definitely authentic ! ! !  my two favourite dishes are the rice flour rolls and the chicken pho . the rice flour rolls are always fresh whenever i 'm there ! and the chicken pho is always flavourful ! ! mmmm ... .just thinking of it makes me want some !  my boyfriend is vietnamese and he agrees that this place is authentic and one of the best vietnamese restaurants he has ever eaten at .  prices are very reasonable too !
DOC15 a must stop when you are in montreal !  i was in mtl for the weekend and wind up eating here 2 nights in a row !  the sandwiches here are unbelieveable ! the smoked meat is so tasty and salty but so good . the bread definitely complements the meat !  not much of a line up if you come either later in the evening .  remember to leave a tip in the plate when you order take out and the servers will be extra nice and funny !
DOC16 i too have been trying to book an appt to use my voucher - it 's been months and countless of phone calls - no response yet .  agree with the buyers beware warning . i only wish reviews on this place was posted previous to my purchase of this voucher .
DOC17 came here with my girlfriends one sunday afternoon . this place will take a long time to serve your food - as it took them almost an hour to give us our food . so make sure you give yourself lots of time ! it is definitely a lazy brunch place !  definitely recommend the pancakes ! beware of the portion sizes - they are huge !
DOC18 came here for a burger as one of my friends said they had good burgers and people from work would come by twice a month for a burger run .  ordered the original was was ok , was n't as amazing as everyone says it to be . i think the veggie option would have been better .  a little pricy for a take-out burger .
DOC19 really excited to hear of this restaurant coming to toronto . when it finally opened , my friend and i were really excited to try this place .  service here is not great , it felt like they had forgotten about us and that they did n't care about the service as everything came out one at a time . my friend and i had each ordered a ginger beer , which came out at two separate times ( it was almost as if they had to go in the back and make it themselves - that 's how long it took ) .  there is absolutely no vegetarian options , except for the one cold noodle - the mushroom bun is not vegetarian .  the pork belly bun was nothing special - just a piece of meat with the bun . for my vegetarian friend , we had ordered the bun plain so she could experience it as well , and they literally just gave it to us plain , with no sauce , no kimchi .  the momofuko ramen was awful . it was bland and mushy . after a few bites , i could n't handle eating anymore .  momofuko is not the place to go if you want real ramen . i 've had better experience with instant noodles .
DOC20 was always intrigued of this place when i pass by on the streetcar . finally decided to try this place out this past summer . read the reviews and everyone had lots of good things to say .  one of my friends has dietary restrictions and needs to have gluten-free items . when i had called to make the dinner reservation , i had asked and the hostess said , yes , we do have gluten-free items that are not just salads . just let the server know when you come in .  excited to find another gluten-free place in town , my friends and i show up for the reservation . upon arrival , the server was really nice and friendly . when we had asked about the gluten-free options , the answer was unfortunately as we do not cook our foods separately , the only gluten-free items are salads . which was a disppointment to us , as we had specifically asked if there were gluten-free items that were n't salads on the menu .  so we decided to just order a couple of apps and drinks as we have been sitting there for quite some time , and it was n't the server 's fault that there was n't any gluten-free items ( we felt bad to just get up and leave ) .  in reading the reviews , everyone thought very highly of the mac and cheese and poutine , we had ordered that to try . it was n't bad , but not sure what the hype was about . definitely pretty rich and filling and made for sharing !
DOC21 this place reminds of st lawrence market in toronto but more veggies and fruits then seafood .  fruits and veggies look so good ! too bad we did n't have a kitchen at our hotel room , cause we would have bought and cooked up a storm ! !  lots of varieties of apples !
DOC22 burgers are very big portions here .  definitely order the onion ring tower to share ...  milkshakes are tasty ! my personal favourite - the vanilla one .
DOC23 food is very bland - not authentic at all .  meant to cater to the customers who have never eaten vietnamese food before .  definitely will not be returning !
DOC24 while looking at different restaurants in the area , came upon this restaurant posting and decided to try it , as it is down the street from work .  not bad when you want something slightly cheaper than congee star . it is a mix of chinese and choy suey menu .
DOC25 service is really slow here . i waited for over 25 mins just for takeout . definitely not worth the wait . however , they seem to have live music friday nites , so if you are looking for entertainment and food sit-in is probably a lot faster
DOC26 a few years ago , this used to be the place to be for bunch . i was really excited to take my boyfriend here to experience one of the `` must visit places in mtl '' . boy were we disappointed !  we had ordered the eggspectation omelette and eggs benedict . the omelette was bland , overcooked . the eggs benedict were ok , but i 've had better . the portion size has come down .  overall , food and service has gone downhill and not worth my time anymore .
DOC27 omg - definitely worth going if you are in montreal ! !  and remember to eat it fresh - it is amazing paired with an organic cream cheese . mmmm ... .
DOC28 not sure what the hype is , but decided to give this a try based on all the reviews .  maybe it was too hyped up , but it was n't as amazing as i thought it would be . maybe it was what we had ordered , but it was just ok. we had ordered the kimchi fries , which was kind of like a ny fries `` the works '' . the grilled pork banh mi was ok .  will be back to try other stuff , like the bao version and the pork belly .
DOC29 love the selection of winter gear here for my little one !  we are a big fan of the canadan pooch line and they carry a variety of jackets and sweaters here . and it 's not just for big dogs - they have different sizes to fit all different size dogs .  good selection of treats and food as well !
DOC30 hidden on the east end of the danforth is a lovely thai restaurant . found this restaurant while surfing on yelp .  surprisingly this place is pretty big to seat a big group of 12 and still have a few more small tables available . they are mainly a take-out restaurant , as many of the customers came in for take-out , and the service was a little bit slow . however , the food was great and it accommodating for many different people - seafood lovers , vegans , etc .  definitely recommend the basil fried rice and the fried sole fish with eggplant but for those curry lovers out there , stay away from the roti curry chicken - no curry taste , just coconut favour . but the roti itself was really good .  most of the dishes were under $ 10 - definitely a good deal !  will be back to try the noodle dishes !
DOC31 if you have not yet tried wasabi - do n't bother .  it 's expensive and the food is disgusting . you have to order the sushi at the table , but everything else ( i.e . salads , soups , cooked food ) you can get up and go get it yourself .  the food is very bland , the sushi does not taste like anything - not even sure if the fish is fresh .  on the weekends , everyone seems to be there for the snow crab legs - if that 's what you are coming for , forget it ! you have to fight\/wait in-line to get it . it 's probably easier to eat it at mandarin .  if anyone suggests to go there , i highly recommend you go somewhere else !
DOC32 decided to try this place after reading the reviews . was not disappointed . huge portions and a bit of a long wait . they will take phone orders over the walk ins . so call ahead to order !  tried the burrito with rice but will be back to try the noodle version ! !
DOC33 great place to bring dogs ! it 's really a dog place that you bring your humans : p  as soon as we walked in , my dog was greeted with treats ! he was so excited to explore the store ...  there are 4 seats that you can sit and have your coffee while your dog lounges in the dog bed in front of you .  truth - this really a store for dogs , not so much for humans even though they offer coffee and tea - but just a handful of choices , nothing crazy : )  the great part is my dog is very picky when it comes to his treats and he really likes the one we had purchased here . guess we will be back for more ...
DOC34 hidden in the east end of the danforth , who knew there would be a little ethiopian community ?  the decor is definitely interesting . although , the outside has lots of lights as decoration , the inside is kind of dark . the red lighting and orange menu makes it hard to read .  the food is not bad . although they tell you that the vegetarian platter is only for one person - this platter is definitely made for sharing !
DOC35 this review is mainly for the pool only .  love that it has a nice indoor salt water pool for the doggies to use . it is small , and only meant for 1 dog at a time . i have a small little one that makes this size work well for him , but not sure how the bigger dogs can really swim in here .  the pool is great as the water is lukewarm so my little guy is willing to go in ( as we have been to another indoor pool which the water is cold ) .  for the 1st time users , they have an instructor there to help assess what your dog can do or not do , that way you do n't scared them off from swimming .  after that , you are free to book time for just you and your pup .  and they have a tub outside of the pool to bath them when they are done .  overall , no complaints with them !
DOC36 it 's 3.5 stars but since i ca n't give half stars i will give it four .  cute shop love the concept !  lots of varieties of cookie but pretty pricy ! there are probably about 10 varieties cookies and about seven milk flavours . the banana flavoured milk reminds us of the banana cough syrup we used to drink as a kid !  they do have homemade cookie ice cream sandwiches but the cookie is on the thinner side .
DOC37 great place in chinatown to get banh mi ! just make sure you know what you want as it is really crazy in there and hectic ! the ladies behind the counter will harass you until you move along !  lots of great prepacked food as well , if the sandwich is n't your thing !
DOC38 very busy place here on a friday night . definitely has a queen street feel with the decor .  food is a little pricey but not bad . shrimp tempura appetizer is a good size for sharing . sweet potato wedges are well paired with the wasabi mayo .  rolls are very good . they have a different pink dragon roll that has scallops on the top . green dragon rolls are definitely a must try . the avocado is very thinly sliced sprinkled with something yummy on top .
DOC39 cute place on a side street - really only serving the locals around the woodbine\/danforth area .  bf ordered a coffee here that he thought was pretty good . they seem to have smoothies and fresh juices as well . and nifty rice bowls .  will be back to try out the juices and food .  seems to be a quiet place to chill for a couple of hours .
DOC40 atmosphere for this restaurant is nice but service , not so much .  came here for a friend 's birthday . although , we made reservations and checked in a few minutes early , we still had to wait a good 45 minutes before sitting down at our table . when we made the reservations , we were informed we would have to leave a certain time - which we did n't think they would enforce , considering we did not get our table in time . however , they did , and we were not impressed .  the space in the restaurant is also very tight , my boyfriend got hit in the head a few times while sitting at the table .  i had ordered a seafood pasta dish , which was kind of bland ( not much flavour ) . my boyfriend had ordered one of the specials of the night - filet mignon , which also was not up to par .  overall , i 've had better pasta . i 'm not sure if it was just the two dishes i had that was n't up to par , as my other friends did enjoy theirs .
DOC41 the loud banging always draws crowds as you walk by and see that the chef is making fresh noodles . noodles are delicious and you definitely need to make sure you save room in your stomach for this when you come to pacific mall !  after trying a few things on the menu - the true favourite is still the dan dan noodles . there is something about the spicy peanut sauce soup base that makes it so flavourful . plus when you add their homemade chili oil - it makes it so good .  because of sun 's dan dan noodles - my bf and i will always order the dan fan noodle whenever we see it on the menu but so far , no one has the same flavour as sun 's . sun 's is the best we have had ! ! !
DOC42 found this bakery while wandering on queen street - it was hidden on a side street .  walked inside to check it out and it was very quaint inside . lots of variety . we had gotten a loaf of brioche bread - it was so good . soft and sweet - just the way it should be .  they have lots of other bread that i ca n't wait to go back and try !
