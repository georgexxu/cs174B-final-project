DOC0 super simple place but amazing nonetheless . it 's been around since the 30 's and they still serve the same thing they started with : a bologna and salami sandwich with mustard .  staff was very helpful and friendly .
DOC1 small unassuming place that changes their menu every so often . cool decor and vibe inside their 30 seat restaurant . call for a reservation .  we had their beef tartar and pork belly to start and a salmon dish and lamb meal for mains . everything was incredible ! i could go on at length about how all the listed ingredients really make their dishes amazing but honestly you just need to go .  a bit outside of downtown montreal but take the metro out and it 's less than a 10 minute walk from the station .
DOC2 lester 's is located in a beautiful neighborhood and has been there since 1951 . they are known for smoked meat which most deli 's have but their brisket sandwich is what i come to montreal for . they 've got about 12 seats outside to go along with the inside .  the smoked meat is up there in quality and taste with schwartz 's and you 'll find less tourists at lester 's as well .
DOC3 love coming here . yes the place always needs the floor swept but when you give out peanuts in the shell how wo n't it always be a bit dirty .  the food speaks for itself , so good . burgers are made to order and the meat is put on the grill when you order your sandwich . getting the small burger just means 1 patty , the regular is a 2 patty burger which is twice the deliciousness .  getting the cajun fries adds a bit of spice to them and whatever size you order they always throw more fries ( a lot more fries ) into the bag .
DOC4 had their chocolate almond croissant and it was amazing ! so light and buttery and oh my how chocolaty .  if you 're looking for a light breakfast then head out here . perfect spot for a coffee\/latt√© before heading out to the old port
DOC5 cycle pub las vegas was a blast ! got a groupon and rented the bike for 11 of us for an afternoon tour . each bar was more fun than the last . downtown las vegas has changed so much and for the better . we had a wide age range in this group from early 20 's to mid 50 's and everyone had so much fun ! our driver tony was knowledgable , friendly and just plain fun ! would recommend this to anyone looking to do something different away from the strip . you wo n't be disappointed !
DOC6 who would have guess that you would be able to get fairly decent vietnamese restaurant in east york ?  not quite the same as chinatown in terms of pricing ( slightly higher ) but definitely one of the better vietnamese restaurants outside of the neighbourhood . when i do n't have time to go to chinatown , this is the next best thing as it is down the street from me .  so far the only items i have tried are the phos ( beef , chicken & vegetarian ) - and they have not disappointed me ! especially the chicken pho .  next time i go back , i 'm going to try the banh cuon ( steamed rice noodle ) and the vermicelli !
DOC7 always drove past this coffee house and wondered about it . bf and i finally made the stop to try this place out .  cute , quaint coffee shop with nice muskoka chairs outside .  bf ordered an ice coffee and really enjoyed it ! guess we will be back again !
DOC8 not bad ! ! love that there is a gluten-free , vegan version of the cheese curds and gravy ! !  have n't done the poutine taste test yet with smoke 's but im excited to see which is better . however poutini 's might win as they are vegan and gluten-free
DOC9 love this place !  peggy is great with dogs and does a great job ! she is very patience with him and will make any adjustments you need before you leave the store . my little guy has no problems coming here .  they also have very good bully sticks ( the non-smelly ones ) that my little guy and his friends love !
DOC10 this is currently my parents new favourite restaurant .  we come here in the morning for dim sum . they are not the cart pushing type of dim sum , it is order off of the sheet . dim sum is not bad and not expensive either .  we also frequent the dinner scene . their set dinner menu is not bad . we typically order a 6 dish menu and it 's big enough to feed a family of 9 with leftovers .  overall , food is pretty tasty !
DOC11 server was a little rude .  ordered the calamari , duck confit poutine and the trout fish with miso soba - all very tasty . definitely not your typical diner .
DOC12 i thought tidy 's flowers had a great reputation as a florist , but i guess i was wrong !  for valentine 's day my boyfriend had ordered roses with tidy 's . however , the flowers that were delivered was not what he had ordered . he had placed in an order for long stem roses , mixed with orchids and was charged for that . what had showed up was a small vase with 4 short cut roses and some greens - table ornament , not really valentine 's day flowers .  in speaking with another friend , something similar happened to her - her fiancee had ordered a dozen of roses for her for valentine 's day while he was in germany as a surprise and they never showed up . so when he called them to complaint , they actually then called up my friend to confirm whether or not she had received the flowers . which she did n't , so they said they would resend - only to have them deliver it to the wrong place .  understanding that valentine 's day is the most busiest day for florists and mistakes do happen , the way they had handled it was not what would have been expected from a florist of that nature .
DOC13 wanted to check out this place due to all the hype i had heard . my friend wanted to come here for her birthday . we had a group of seven and based on the way the seating works ( as it is communal ) , we wind up sharing with another group of five .  food was ok - not sure what the hype was . almost 75 % of the dishes had some sort of cheese in it .  this place is very loud so not ideal for catching up\/talking . not a great place to go if you have any gluten or vegan restrictions .  interesting concept . would definitely recommend to try this place once - but definitely not worth the 30- 45 mins wait .
DOC14 this place is awesome ! definitely authentic ! ! !  my two favourite dishes are the rice flour rolls and the chicken pho . the rice flour rolls are always fresh whenever i 'm there ! and the chicken pho is always flavourful ! ! mmmm ... .just thinking of it makes me want some !  my boyfriend is vietnamese and he agrees that this place is authentic and one of the best vietnamese restaurants he has ever eaten at .  prices are very reasonable too !
