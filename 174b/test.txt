DOC0 super simple place but amazing nonetheless . it 's been around since the 30 's and they still serve the same thing they started with : a bologna and salami sandwich with mustard .  staff was very helpful and friendly .
DOC1 small unassuming place that changes their menu every so often . cool decor and vibe inside their 30 seat restaurant . call for a reservation .  we had their beef tartar and pork belly to start and a salmon dish and lamb meal for mains . everything was incredible ! i could go on at length about how all the listed ingredients really make their dishes amazing but honestly you just need to go .  a bit outside of downtown montreal but take the metro out and it 's less than a 10 minute walk from the station .
DOC2 lester 's is located in a beautiful neighborhood and has been there since 1951 . they are known for smoked meat which most deli 's have but their brisket sandwich is what i come to montreal for . they 've got about 12 seats outside to go along with the inside .  the smoked meat is up there in quality and taste with schwartz 's and you 'll find less tourists at lester 's as well .
DOC3 love coming here . yes the place always needs the floor swept but when you give out peanuts in the shell how wo n't it always be a bit dirty .  the food speaks for itself , so good . burgers are made to order and the meat is put on the grill when you order your sandwich . getting the small burger just means 1 patty , the regular is a 2 patty burger which is twice the deliciousness .  getting the cajun fries adds a bit of spice to them and whatever size you order they always throw more fries ( a lot more fries ) into the bag .
